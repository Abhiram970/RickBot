Rick: Morty, you got to come on. You got to come with me.
Morty: Rick, what’s going on?
Rick: I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Morty: It’s the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Rick: I got a surprise for you.
Rick starts pulling Morty out of bed and dragging him out of the room
Morty: Ow! Ow! You’re tugging me too hard.
Rick: I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Rick and Morty are in Rick’s Space Cruiser, flying over the city, late at night
Rick: What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, it’s great. Is this the surprise?
Rick: Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
Morty: What?! A bomb?!
Rick: We’re gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
Morty: T-t-that’s absolutely crazy!
Rick: Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It’s gonna be good. Right now, we’re gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
Morty: Jessica? From my math class?
Rick: When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I’m gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you’re gonna be Adam.
Morty: Whoa.
Rick: And Jessica’s gonna be Eve,…
Morty: Whhhh-wha?
Rick: And so that’s the surprise, Morty.
Morty: No, you can’t! Jessica doesn’t even know I exist but but forget about that, because you can’t blow up humanity.
Rick: I-I get what you’re trying to say, Morty. Listen, I’m not you don’t you don’t got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I’m I’m not that kind of guy, Morty.
Morty: What are you talking about, Rick?
Rick: You you don’t have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she’s all for you, Morty.
Morty: I don’t care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You’re right.
Rick: Let’s forget the girl all together. She she’s probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
(Rick presses a button, activating the neutrino bomb)
Robot Voice: Arming neutrino bomb.
Morty: That’s it that’s it, Rick. I’m taking the wheel.
(Morty jumps up on Rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel)
Rick: Get off of me, Morty!
Morty: I’m taking charge of this situation, buddy. What’s gotten into you? I’m I’m I’m I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world.
Rick: All right, all right. I’ll I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
(Rick deactivates the neutrino bomb and lands the cruiser in an open desert)
Rick: We’ll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here.
Morty: Oh, thank God.
Rick: You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
Morty: It was?
Rick: Sure. Why not? I don’t know. You you know what, mo-
(Rick falls asleep, activating the neutrino bomb again and the earth begins to shake)
Robot Voice: Neutrino bomb armed.
Morty: Um…
Jerry: I see there’s a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
(A very tired Morty falls asleep at the table, smashing his face into his plate)
Summer: Oh, my God, his head is in his food. I’m going to puke.
(Beth helps Morty get up off the table)
Beth: Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow. The dog sleeps on it.
Morty: I wasn’t kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
Summer: Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.
Jerry (Angry): What?!
Beth (Disappointed): Dad?
Rick: What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?
Jerry: Damn it!
Beth (Angry): Jerry!
Jerry: Beth!
Summer: Oh, my God, my parents are so loud, I want to die.
Rick: Mm, there is no God, Summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You’ll thank me later.
Jerry: Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?
Rick: Listen, Jerry, I don’t want to overstep my bounds or anything. It’s your house. It’s your world. You’re a real Julius Caesar but I’ll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It’s a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it’s it’s not a place for smart people, Jerry and I know that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s my two cents on the issue.
(Rick gets up and leaves to go put his dishes away and talks to Beth as he passes by her)
Rick: This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.
(Rick gives Beth a kiss and she starts to tear up in joy, moved by what he said to her)
Beth (Happy): Oh, dad.
Jerry: What? For real?
(Morty’s face slams into his plate again)

(Morty is in class at school and Mr. Goldenfold is yelling at them)
Mr. Goldenfold: All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we’re gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It’s called math and without it, none of us would even exist, so let’s jump right in. 2 plus 2.
All classmates except Morty: 4.
(Morty is seen staring at Jessica in love, saying her name while the other students answer the questions)
Morty: Jessica.
Mr. Goldenfold: 5 plus 5.
All classmates except Morty: 10.
Morty: Jessica.
(Jessica hears Morty and looks back, confused, but doesn’t know who said her name)
Mr. Goldenfold: Okay, good. It’s time for the quiz.
Class (Disappointed): Awwwwww.
Mr. Goldenfold (Furious): Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take 1.
(Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. There’s crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y’all getting dumber. Some of y’all ain’t gonna see 3:00.)
(Morty falls asleep in class and enters a dream-world with Jessica in it)
Jessica: Hi, Morty.
Morty: Whoa! Hi, Jessica.
Jessica: Can I show these to you?
(Jessica opens her shirt, showing Morty her boobs)
Morty: Wow. Th-they’re both great.
Jessica: Thank you. You know what I named these? My little Morties.
Morty: Uh, that’s flattering and a little weird.
Jessica: Do you know what I want you to do with them?
Morty: Rename them?
Jessica: Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers.
Morty: Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let’s give this a shot.
(Morty grabs her boobs and starts fondling her)
Jessica: Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?
Morty: Uh, I-I’m just doing my best.
(It then shows real life, where Morty is seen folding an extremely furious Mr. Goldenfold in his sleep)
Mr. Goldenfold (Extremely Furious): Morty! What are you doing to me?!
Morty (Sleep Talking): Jessica.
Mr. Goldenfold: Morty!
Morty: Jessica.
Mr. Goldenfold (Less angry): 5 more minutes of this, and I’m gonna get mad.
(Mr. Goldenfold leans back and takes pleasure from this)
Morty: Je-Jessica. Jessica.
Mr. Goldenfold: Not my fault this is happening.

(After class, Morty is at his locker, where he is confronted by school bully, Frank Paliky)
Frank: Well, well, well.
Morty; Uh, morning, Frank.
(Frank pins Morty to his locker)
Frank: "Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family’s poor?
(Frank takes out a pocket knife and point it at Morty’s neck)
Morty: Oh, geez, Frank. I don’t know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
Frank: You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I’m gonna cut you, ‘cause my family’s rich.
(Frank becomes frozen and Rick appears behind him, revealing himself to be the one who froze him)
Rick: There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.
Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what’d you do to Frank?
Rick: It’s pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (Belch) It’s important. Come on, Morty.
Morty: I don’t know, Rick. I can’t leave school again.
Rick: Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!
Morty: Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn’t you unfreeze him?
Rick: I’ll do it later, Morty. He’ll be fine. Let’s go.
(Rick takes off with Morty and then Summer comes by, seeing Frank’s frozen body)
Summer (In her head): Oh, my God. I’m about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we’ll be telling our children.
(Summer, oblivious to the fact that he’s frozen, apparently, walks up to Frank and talks to him)
Summer: Hi, Frank. (Frank’s frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying) AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!

(Beth is at the Horse Hospital, performing heart surgery on a horse with Davin)
Beth: Scalpel. Davin: Scalpel.
Jerry: (enters the room) Knock, knock.
Beth: Jerry?
Jerry: My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"
(The heart rate for the horse starts beeping really fast)
Tom (Offscreen): We’re losing him.
(Beth adjusts the horse’s organs)
Tom (Offscreen): Okay, he’s back.
Beth: Jerry, please tell me you’re here for an incredibly urgent reason.
Jerry: Well, it’s lunch. I mean, it’s one of three meals that have existed for millennia.
(The heart rate starts beeping again)
Tom (Offscreen): Losing him.
(Beth adjusts the organs again)
Tom (Offscreen): Stabilized.
Beth: Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.
Jerry: Well, yeah, on horses.
Beth (Angry): Excuse me?
Jerry (Scared): Okay, Let’s not rehash that fight. (Normal) I sense that you’re busy and will now be on my way.
(Jerry drops a pamphlet on the ground)
Jerry (Poorly Acting): Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let’s put your dad here. (Straight out serious) Let’s put your dad in a nursing home.
(Beth looks at Jerry extremely angry at him and the heart hate starts beeping again)
Tom (Offscreen): We’re losing him.
Beth: Hey, Tom! We know when we’re losing him. (At the top of her lungs) WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!

(Rick and Morty are in an alley and Rick uses his portal gun to open a portal)
Rick: There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let’s go.
Morty: Oh, geez, okay.

(Rick and Morty go through the portal and end up an a crazy alternate dimension)
Morty: Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?
Rick: It’s Dimension 35-C, and it’s got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there’s fruit in those trees, and there’s seeds in those fruits. I’m talking about mega seeds. They’re they’re incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.
Morty: Oh, man, Rick. I’m looking around this place, and I’m starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.
Rick: All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You’re looking around, and it’s all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that’s how we grow as people. I’m no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we’re gonna be-
(A gigantic alien monster suddenly appears behind them)
Rick (Terrified): HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!
(Rick and Morty take off, running in complete and total fear as the monster chases them)
Rick: I never seen that thing before in my life. I don’t even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It’s gonna kill us! We’re gonna die! We’re gonna die, Morty!
(Screen cuts to black for the intermission break)
(Having apparently escaped, Rick & Morty are walking through Dimension 35-C, continuing their adventure)
Rick: Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That’s the smell of adventure, Morty. That’s-that’s the smell of of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
Morty: All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn’t I be back at school by now?
Rick: Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. (A weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) What the hell is that thing? You think you’re gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic, that thing.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, I get it. We’re surrounded by monsters. That’s kind of the reason why I want to leave.
(They come up to a cliff and Rick stops him there)
Rick: Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?
(Rick & Morty are looking down upon a vast forest of interdimensional trees)
Rick: You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?
Morty: The mega trees?
Rick: That’s right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that’s what I’m talking about, Morty. That’s where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you’re so in love with school.
Morty: All right, all right. So, what’s so special about these seeds, anyways?
Rick: You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an (belch) Under (belch) underfoot figure.
(Rick gives Morty a pair of shoes and Morty proceeds to put them on)
Rick: Just take these shoes, Morty. They’re (belch) special grappling shoes. When you’re wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.
(Morty walks off the cliff and plummets to the ground, screaming and smashing into rocks)
Morty: AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
Rick: You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!

(During Beth’s break, back at the hospital, Jerry and Beth are in Beth’s office, arguing)
Beth: I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month’s Victoria’s secret?
Jerry: I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine’s day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.
(Davin shows up at the door and starts hitting on Beth)
Davin: Everything cool in here, Beth?
Beth: It’s fine, Davin.
Davin: Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There’s nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.
(Jerry closes the door on Davin)
Jerry: Since we’re fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
Beth: Look, I appreciate the stress you’re under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.
(The phone starts ringing)
Jerry (Sad): (Sigh) Well, maybe you’re right.
Beth: Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I’m my father’s daughter. I’m smart. Why do you think I’m a heart surgeon?
Jerry: (Cough) Ahem, Horse heart surgeon.
(Beth answers the phone and gets a call from Morty’s principal, Gene Vagina)

Principal Vagina: Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty’s father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?

(Rick is standing by Morty, who is lying on the ground and his legs are broken)
Rick: Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on (Offscreen) your legs right now. You know, you got to turn (Onscreen) the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.
Morty: I’m in a lot of pain, Rick!
Rick: Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you’ll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?
Morty (Angry): Are you kidding me?! That’s it, Rick! That’s the last straw! I can’t believe this! I’m sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you’re still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you’re a monster. Y-you’re like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
Rick: Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
(Rick opens another portal and leaves Morty behind, lying on the ground to suffer for a few seconds)
Morty: Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
(Rick finally returns and injects Morty’s legs with medicine, healing them to perfection)
Morty (Happy): Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I’ve never felt so good in my life. Thank you.
Rick: Don’t worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?
Morty: Sure thing, Rick.
(Morty goes up the tree and gets the Mega fruit while Rick talks to him)
Rick: Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (Offscreen) The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
Morty: Wow, that’s pretty crazy, Rick.
Rick: There’s just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that (belch) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. (belch) It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it’s got no charge left, Morty. It’s got no charge left.
Morty: What?!
Rick: It’s as good as garbage, Morty. It’s not gonna work anymore, Morty.
Morty: Oh, geez, Rick, that’s not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?
Rick: There’s ways to get back home, Morty. It’s just it’s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We’re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you’re gonna have to do me a real solid.
Morty: Uh-oh.
Rick: When we get to customs, I’m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I’m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.
Morty: In my butt?
Rick: Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. I really don’t want to have to do that.
Rick: Well, somebody’s got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren’t gonna get through customs unless they’re in someone’s rectum, Morty
Morty: Uuuh.
Rick: And they’ll fall right out of mine. I’ve done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you’re young. Y-y-you’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y(belch)-you’ve got to put these seeds inside your butt.
Morty: In my butt?
Rick: Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.
Morty: Oh, man.

(Beth & Jerry are at Morty’s school, walking down the hallway with Principal Vagina)
Principal Vagina: The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.
Beth: What? Why didn’t you notify us?
Principal Vagina: I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I’ve been leaving with Morty’s grandfather?
Jerry: Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?
Principal Vagina: Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it’s usually Morty’s grandpa that’s taking him out of school.
(They stop to see Summer & some other students, crying at an obituary for Frank)
Beth: Summer?
Summer (crying): What kind of God lets this happen?
Principal Vagina: We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. (chuckles) And there’s no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won’t let them.

(Morty is exiting the bathroom at Intergalactic Customs, and passes by a bunch of aliens)
Announcer: The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
Alien: So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know? This this guy he doesn’t understand interstellar currency.
Alien: It’s, like, I’m trying to eat a flimflam like, that’s what we eat on girvonesk.
Announcer: The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
(Morty comes up to Rick, who is waiting in line to get through security)
Rick: I don’t like it here, Morty. I can’t abide bureaucracy. I don’t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let’s just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.
Rick: That means they’re good ones. You’re a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You’ve been a huge help to me. I’m gonna be able to do a-(Belch)-all kind of things with them. It’s gonna be great, Morty. A-(Belch)-all kinds of science.
(The aliens are going through security with a Gromfomite, letting them through)
Gromfomite: Okay, next through. (Stops Morty) Except you. You go over there.
Rick: Why does he have to go over there?
Gromfomite: Random check. He’s got to go through the new machine.
Rick: What new (Belch) what new machine?
Gromfomite: It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
Rick: Run, Morty! Run!
(Rick grabs Morty and they run through security and dart for the exit)
Morty: Aaaaaah!
Gromfomite: Red alert!
(A team of Gromfomites start chasing after Rick and Morty)
Morty: Ohhhhh!
(Rick pushes over a giant capsule, with an alien fetus over, smashing some gromfomites, to slow them down)
Morty: Ohhhhhh!
(Rick & Morty crash through a life support system for a trapped alien life form. The alien becomes freed, and starts running through the glarp zone and goes through the entire aging process from developing fetus to decomposing corpse, over the course of three seconds)
Morty (Horrified): Aaaaah!
Rick: Don’t think about it!
(Rick & Morty become cornered but Morty activates the grappling shoes and runs up the wall with Rick)
Rick: Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.
(The Gromfomites reveal that they can fly and then Rick & Morty start running away)
Morty: Whoooooo!
(Rick & Morty run through the equipment on the ceiling, before they slip off to the ground)
Alien: Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I’m just trying to-
(Rick & Morty crash to the ground and the alien dies. They then run to the portal computer)
Rick: I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
(Rick tosses Morty a gun)
Morty: Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don’t want to shoot nobody.
Rick: They’re just robots, Morty! It’s okay to shoot them! They’re robots!
(Morty shoots a Glenn, blowing his leg off, and making blood gush out as he drops down in pain)
Glenn: Aaaaah! My leg is shot off!
Other Gromfomite: Glenn’s bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children!
Morty: They’re not robots, Rick!
Rick: It’s a figure of speech, Morty. They’re bureaucrats. I don’t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!
(Morty continues shooting up the Gromfomites and even kills some innocent bystanders while Rick hacks into the portal to take them back home)
Morty: Holy crap! This is insane!
(Rick opens the portal and takes Morty in with him)
Rick: Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!

(The portal opens up in the lunchroom at school and Rick & Morty land on the table where Jessica & her friends are eating)
Jessica: Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
Morty (nervous): Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari’s in the shop. (nervously laughs) Just kidding.
Jessica: You’re Morty, right?
Morty (happy): Yeah.
(Rick grabs Morty and takes him way)
Rick: You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
(Rick and Morty are stopped by Jerry, Beth, and Principal Vagina)
Jerry (angry): Oh, look, honey. It’s our son with Albert Ein-douche.
Beth (confused): What?
Jerry (put off): I’m an angry father, not an improvisor.
Rick: Oh, hi, Jerry. (poorly acting) Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior… No? No takers?

(Rick and Morty are back at home in the garage while Jerry and Beth start taking all his things and packing them up so he can move to the nursing home)
Rick: You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It’s beyond your reasoning.
Jerry (angry): You’re beyond our reasoning!
Rick: Takes one to know one.
Beth (angry and disappointed): Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it’s not like he’s a hot girl. He can’t just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else’s.
Rick: What-what are you guys doing with my stuff?
Beth: We’re moving you to a nursing home.
Rick: A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I’m a genius. I build robots for fun.
Jerry: Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas.
Beth (confused): What does that mean?
Jerry (put off): It’s personal.
Morty: Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.
Jerry: Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
Rick: What are you trying to say about Morty? That he’s stupid or something?
Beth: Oh, don’t high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.
Rick: I-I-I don’t know what you mean by that. Can-can-can you be a little bit more specific?
Jerry: Oh, for crying out- he’s got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?
Morty: I do?
Jerry: Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you’re not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.
Morty: Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that’s a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
Rick: Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.
Morty: Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can’t.
Rick: The square root of pi, Morty. Go!
Morty: 1.77245385 Whoa!
Beth: What the hell?
Jerry: Holy crap. He’s right.
Rick: Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
Morty: "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I’m so smart!
Jerry: But-
Rick: I told the both of you school is stupid. It’s not how you learn things. Morty’s a gifted child. He has a special mind. That’s why he’s my little helper. He’s like me. He’s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He’s too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
Beth: Jerry, I don’t want whatever’s happening here to stop.
Jerry: No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.
Rick: Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it’s gonna be clear communication.
(Summer buts in, crying over the death of Frank)
Summer (in tears): Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!
Rick: No idea what you’re talking about.
(Summer leaves, crying)
Jerry: Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it’s your bedtime in an hour. Don’t stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you’ll have me, I would love to have you.
Beth: You know what? Okay.
(Beth & Jerry leave)
Morty: Holy cow, Rick. I didn’t know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
Rick: Full disclosure, Morty it’s not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
Morty: Aw, man.
Rick: Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you’re gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you’re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.
Starting right about now.
Morty: Ohh, man. (Losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh.
(Morty drops to the ground and starts moaning as he has a seizure)
Rick: I’m sorry, Morty. It’s a bummer. In reality, you’re as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we’re gonna have to go get more
(While Morty has a seizure, Rick excitedly looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures)
Rick (Excitedly): And then we’re gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you’re gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don’t understand what’s important, and they’ll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I’m gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you’re gonna be part of them, and together, we’re gonna run around, Morty. We’re gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We’re the only friends we’ve got, Morty. It’s just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty’s things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.
(Jerry and Summer are in the living room. Jerry is flipping through channels on TV and Summer is texting)
TV: Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby.
beautiful putt right there good birdie.
That's only the eighth birdie of the day.
(Snuffles walks up to Jerry are sits there, looking at him)
Jerry: What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? (Sigh)
(Jerry opens the door to let Snuffles out but he still just stands there)
Jerry: Outside?
(Snuffles pees on the carpet)
Jerry: Are you kidding me?! Come on!
Summer: Oh, my God.
(Morty hears his dad yelling and runs into the room to check up on him)
Morty: What's wrong?
Jerry: Your idiot dog!
Morty: Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.
Jerry: Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!
(Jerry grabs Snuffles by the head and stuffs his face into the pee puddle just as Rick walks in)
Rick: Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.
Jerry: Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?
Rick: I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.
Jerry: Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!
Summer: Ha-ha!
Morty: Aw, man!
Rick: Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
(Rick goes into the garage and quickly whips up a helmet and comes back and puts it on Snuffles)
Rick: All right, Ruffles What's his name?
Morty: Snuffles.
Rick: Snuffles, shake.
(Snuffles understands his and shakes)
Rick: Roll over.
(Snuffles rolls over)
Rick: Go to the bathroom.
(Snuffles goes out of the room, a toilet flush is heard, and then he returns)
Jerry: Holy crap!
Summer: No way.
Rick: Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.
(Rick and Morty go into the garage)
Morty: That was fantastic, Rick!
Rick: Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
(Rick shows Morty a tiny metal ear-piece like device)
Morty: W-w-w-what is it?
Rick: It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
Morty: You talking about "Inception"?
Rick: That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may-(Belch)-be make sense.
Morty: "Inception" made sense.
Rick: You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.
Morty: Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?
Rick: Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.
(Rick and Morty get into the space cruiser and start going off)
Rick: Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.
(Mr. Goldenfold is in his home, watching TV on the couch, eating nachos, half asleep)
Mrs. Pancakes: You don't know me!
Mr. Goldenfold:' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.
(Mr. Goldenfold falls asleep just as Rick and Morty sneak in through his window)
Commercial Announcer: Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"
Mrs. Pancakes: You don't know me!
Mr. Pancakes: Then let me get to know yo, damn it!
Rick: Uh-oh! Spoilers!
(Rick quickly turns off the TV)
Rick: I'm a full season behind.
Morty: Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Rick: It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
(Rick puts inception devices on everyone and they enter Mr. Goldenfold's dream. Here, he is sitting on the airplane and Mrs. Pancakes is the flight attendant serving snacks)
Mrs. Pancakes: Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
Mr. Goldenfold: I'll take two.
Mrs. Pancakes: Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.
Mr.Goldenfold: You don't know me.
Rick: All right, Morty, time to make our move.
(Rick grabs some sodas and a cloth while Mr. Goldenfold and Mrs. Pancakes play around with each other)
Mr. Goldenfold: Make it bounce.
Mrs. Pancakes: No, you didn't.
Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, jiggle it now.
Mrs. Pancakes: You better stop with that.
(Rick and Morty jump out, disguised as Muslim terrorists, wearing soda bottles as bombs and Morty wearing the cloth on his head like an Islamic woman)
Rick: Allahu (Belch) akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
(The passengers are frozen in shock, but Mr. Goldenfold gets up and stands against him)
Rick: Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
Mr. Goldenfold: The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
(Mr. Goldenfold throws a bunch of wheat thins at them, and it cuts their flesh like ninja stars)
Rick: Take cover, Morty!
(Mr. Goldenfold suddenly takes out two giant firearms and starts firing them at the two, just after Rick and Morty hide behind the seats, sheltering themselves from the attacks.)
Mr. Goldenfold: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Morty: Ooohhh!
Rick: Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. (Belch) I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
Morty: What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
Rick: Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!
(Jerry is in the living room, controlling Snuffles and showing to Beth how cool it is)
Jerry: Now bring me my slippers.
(Snuffles brings Jerry his slippers)
Summer: Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.
(Snuffles stands in front of her and Summer rests her feet there)
Jerry: This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
Beth (Unimpressed): Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.
Jerry: You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?
(Everyone is silent for a few seconds while Beth gives him blank stare. Jerry slowly starts to fade into a depressed state as Beth walks off, leaving him)
Snuffles: Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
Summer: Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something. (Offscreen) That is so awesome.
Snuffles: Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
Jerry: Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".
Snuffles: Ooooyayawawa!
Summer: He's saying "I love Obama". (Offscreen) So cute! I'm posting this (Onscreen) online, like, right now.
Jerry: I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
(Jerry and Summer leave the room and Snuffles sadly walks over the the glass door and sees his helmet in the reflection)
Snuffles: Hmm?
(Snuffles finds the battery case on his helmet and then goes into the kitchen, where he finds a drawer full of batteries)
(Mr. Goldenfold is still shooting things up in the plane and Rick attempts to make peace with him)
Rick: Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
Mr.Goldenfold: Why would I negotiate with you?
Rick: Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
(Rick takes out Mrs. Pancakes)
Mr. Goldenfold: Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
Plane Passengers: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick: Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.
Plane Passenger: Oh no! Run!
(One of the passengers beats the airlock off the plane and everyone flies out)
Plane Passengers: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Morty: Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
(Rick and Morty fall out of the plane, plummeting to their dooms)
Morty: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Rick: Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!
(Rick and Morty grab onto Mrs. Pancakes are her parachute deploys)
Mrs. Pancakes: Hey, you don't know me!
Morty: Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a (Offscreen) mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!
Rick: Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!
Mrs. Pancakes: You don't know m-
(Rick slaps Mrs. Pancakes, knocking her out, and then incepts her dream with Morty)
Rick: All right, let's go.
(Rick and Morty go inside of her dream which is a bizarre S&M dungeon filled with obscure gooey, monstrous, alien-like creatures)
Morty: Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.
Rick: Don't judge, Morty.
Morty: Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
Rick: Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.
(Rick leaves Morty and blends in and then Morty in confronted by a sexualized creature)
Sexualized S&M Monster: Ooh, hey!
Morty: Ooh, oh! Oh, man.
(Many more creatures come up and try to seduce him, making him more uncomfortable)
Sexualized S&M Monster: Come and join us.
(Morty starts running)
Morty: I'm sorry. No, no.
Sexualized S&M Monster: Ooh, come here!
Morty: No, thanks!
Giant Frog Woman: Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby!
Morty: No, I'm okay.
(Morty bumps into a human being who looks very hot)
Morty: Whoa!
(The human is revealed to be his sister, Summer)
Morty (Shocked): Summer?!
Summer: Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?
(Summer shakes her tits in his face)
Morty: Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
(Morty starts running away from her and Rick comes up)
Rick: Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.
Morty: It's Summer! Aw, geez.
Rick; Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.
Summer: Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.
Rick (In Unison With Morty): Oh, my God. Put some clothes on for the love of God Summer! Put some - I'm gunna puke! I swear to God I'm gunna puke!
Morty (In Unison With Rick): Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! I can't take it, Rick!
(Everyone in the dungeon starts noticing them and then an angry centaur who is very much in charge shows up)
Centaur: Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads!
Rick: Time to go another dream deep, Morty!
(Rick pops the neck of the centaur and they hook up more devices and incept his dream)
(Rick and Morty appear in a dark and horrid red rusted chamber where the Centaur is shuttering in fear)
Morty: What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
Pancakes' dream version of a Centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?
Rick: Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?
(A horrible Freddy Krueger monster named Scary Terry shows up, and starts to horrify them)
Scary Terry: Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!
Rick: Oh, here we go!
Morty: Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
(Rick and Morty start running and Scary Terry chases after them)
Rick: Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
Scary Terry: I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
(Jerry and Summer are in the living room and Snuffles appears with a robotic arm attached to his helmet)
Jerry: Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?
(Snuffles is now able to communicate and speak English through the helmet)
Snuffles: Snuffles fix. Make better.
Summer: Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
Snuffles: Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
Jerry: Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.
Summer: Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.
Jerry: Why not?
Summer: I don't know. It's Indian giving.
(Snuffles turns on the TV to a documentary on dogs and starts watching it)
TV: A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.
Summer: Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.
(Back in the dream, Rick and Morty are running for their lives, when they come across a creepy singing jump roping girl)
Little Girl: "A," "b" his name is scary Terry "C," "d" he's very scary.
Rick: Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
Morty: Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!
Little Girl: "E," "f" he'll design your death
Rick: The little girl!
Morty: Huh?
(Rick and Morty knock out the little girl and incept her dream, only to go into a place exactly like the one they're already in)
Little Girl: "J," "k," he'll really ruin your day.
Rick: Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.
Scary Terry: Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!
Morty: Ohhhh!
Rick: Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!
(Summer is sleeping in the middle of the night but is then woken up by Snuffles, who now has an entire robot body)
Snuffles: Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?
Summer (Scared): Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles.
Snuffles: Do not call me that!
(Snuffles smashes the mirror, making Summer shriek in fear)
Snuffles: "Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
Summer: Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.
Snuffles: Scaring you?
(Snuffles smashes the mirror, making Summer shriek in fear)
Summer: AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Snuffles: Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?
Summer: Uhhh ...
(Beth and Jerry rush into the room, hearing her scream and they notice Snuffles)
Jerry: Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?
Snuffles: Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?
Jerry (Scared): No! No, we were uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to uh ...
Beth (Scared): G-Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!
Summer: Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
(Beth, Jerry, and Summer try to leave, but they are stopped by another dog with a robotic mind control suit)
Snuffles: You will walk when it is time to walk.
(Screen cuts to black for the intermission break)
Rick: What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
Morty: We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?
Rick: Oh, yeah.
(Scary Terry appears in the car)
Scary Terry: Buckle up, bitch!
Morty: Ooooooaaahhh!
(Rick and Morty start running)
Morty: Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!
Scary Terry: You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
Rick: Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.
Morty: But that's the opposite of what-
Rick: Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
Morty: Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.
Rick: Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
(A time lapse transition card shows up, reading "Six dream hours later". Rick and Morty are seen hiding and Scary Terry goes past them, still looking for them and not knowing where they are)
Morty: Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.
Rick: Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
Scary Terry: You can run But you can't hide! (Yawn)
Rick: Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.
(Scene cuts back to the dogs. They are working in a factory and Jerry, Summer, and Beth are seen, trapped in a cage.)
Jerry: Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.
Summer: Dad, he wants to be called snowball.
Jerry: Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.
Snuffles: You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.
(Another dog comes out with a pair of mayo scissors)
Jerry: Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
(Scene cuts back to the dream realm. cary Terry is going back home to his family.)
Scary Melissa: Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day?
Scary Terry: I don't want to talk about it!
Scary Melissa (Angry): Oh, of course! You never want to talk about it!
Scary Terry (Angry): Get off my back, bitch!
(Scary Brandon, the baby, starts crying)
Scary Melissa (Angry): Out there. Not in here!
Scary Terry: Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa.
Scary Melissa: I love you, too, Terry.
(Rick and Morty are watching from outside the window)
Rick: Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.
(Rick and Morty go into the Terry's room, when Terry and Melissa are fast asleep)
Rick: Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Morty: Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.
(Rick and Morty incept his dream and he's having a school related dream)
Scary Terry: Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!
(Scary Terry goes to class)
Monster Teacher: Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?
Scary Terry: Oh, uh, um ... "Bitch."
(The class laughs at him)
Monster Teacher: Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Morty: Hey, leave him alone!
Rick: Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?
Monster Teacher: Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.
Rick: You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
Morty: Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.
Scary Terry: Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.
Morty: You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.
Rick: You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.
(Scary Terry wakes up from his dream and sees Rick and Morty)
Scary Terry: Oh, hey, it's you guys!
(That morning, Rick, Morty, and the Terry family are having breakfast in the kitchen)
Scary Melissa: I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.
Scary Terry: If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.
Rick: As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
(Rick, Morty, and Terry escape the dream and confront the little girl)
Little Girl:' "Q," "r," you won't get very far.
Scary Terry: I always hated that song!
(Scary Terry kills the little girl and then goes on to the centaur)
Scary Terry: These halves don't belong together, bitch!
(Scary Tells kills the centaur and moves onto Mrs. Pancakes)
Scary Terry: Sex is sacred!
(Scary Terry kills Mrs. Pancakes and launches himself at Mr. Goldensfold)
Scary Terry: This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!
(Scary Terry destroys Mr. Goldenfold, causing him to wake up from his dream, in shock)
Mr. Goldenfold: Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought.
(Rick and Morty fist bump behind the couch)

Morty: What the hell?
Rick: Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?
Morty: Oh, man, what's going on?
Rick: Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
Jerry: I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
Summer: This is why I choose to get C's.
Rick: Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
Morty:- Dad! - Rick! - Oh, thank God, Morty.
- Oh, you're welcome.
All right, let's get out of here.
Rick: If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
Jerry: Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.
Rick: It's all over, Jerry.
The dogs are on a path to total world domination.
But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
Jerry: Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. (Jerry pees on a pile of guns) See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.
Snuffles: Bad person. Bad.
Rick: Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
Snuffles: Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.
Morty: Th-thanks, snuffles.
Snuffles: Begin phase two.
(The military can be seen on TV fighting the dogs)
Reporter: Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. (Two dogs come into the news room with a muzzle)
Please! Please don't kill me!
Dog 1: What's she saying, Bill?
Bill: I think she's saying, "I love lasagna.
(Morty is in a bed with two naked girls, and a dog brings him refreshments)
Morty: Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!
Rick: No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
Morty: What?
Rick: It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.
Morty: But I-it's been like a whole year!
Rick: It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.
Morty: Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.
Rick: No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.
Morty: Aw, man, geez! Seriously?
Rick: Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.
Morty: Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?
Rick: Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
Morty: What?!
Rick: It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.
(Snuffles and a few other dogs, Rick also dressed up as one, stand around Morty, who looks close to death on his medical table)
Dr. Dog: It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation.
Snuffles: Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
Accountant Dog: Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom.
Snuffles: To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.
Accountant Dog: Do you think they would have done this for us?
Snuffles: We are not them! We are not them. (Snuffles wakes up from the dream) Assemble the troops. I've made a decision.
(Outside where the dogs are seen portaling to another world)
Snuffles: Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.
Morty: I'm gonna miss you, snowball.
Snuffles: You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.
(Snuffles portals away, Jerry starts tearing up)
Beth: Jerry?
Jerry: I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller.
Beth: Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.
Morty: Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.
Rick: I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
Morty: You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
Rick: What do you know, Morty? What do you know?
Scary Glenn: Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill.
Rick: Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch. (Terry and Rick are getting stoned)
(Open Ext. Smith residence.)

(Outside, there is snow on the ground. The Smith house is decorated for Christmas, and Jerry can be heard singing "Last King Christmas".)

Jerry: *singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!

(Trans Int. Kitchen)

(The kitchen is a mess of food in various stages of preparation. Jerry pulls a ham out of the oven as he sings.)

Jerry: *singing* In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.

(Jerry enters the living room, where a tree stands with presents underneath it. Beth and Morty are occupied on tablets while Summer uses her smartphone.)

Jerry: Um, Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?

Beth: Alive? For your parents?

(Jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.)

Jerry: Good one.

Beth: Hey man!

Jerry: You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.

Morty: *not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.

Jerry: Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.

Morty: *hands over his tablet* Ohhhh…

Summer: Dad, I’m not giving you my phone.

Jerry: Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I’m joining Facebook.

(Summer gasps and drops her phone in the stocking.)

Rick: *offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody.

(Rick and Ruben enter the house and Jerry approaches them.)

Jerry: More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!

Rick: Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.

Ruben: Pearl Harbor.

Rick: I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.

Beth: Aw, Dad… That is so sweet.

Jerry: *squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don’t get it.

Ruben: Korea.

Rick: Don’t worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I’ll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.

(Rick and Ruben head out to the garage.)

Jerry: Huh. You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there’s my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!

(Leonard and Joyce walk in.)

Leonard: Merry Christmas, son.

(Jerry, not noticing Jacob, almost closes the door on him, then opens it back up.)

Jerry: Oh, hi. Can I help you?

Joyce: Jerry, this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn’t you get our text message?

Beth, Summer, and Morty: No.

Jacob: You must be Jerry! That’s a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?

Jerry: *smiling uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you’re a…friend of the family…?

Leonard: *puts an arm around Jacob’s shoulders* The way we see it, he’s a part of the family.

Jerry: Wow!

Joyce: After your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?

Beth: Holy crap, Joyce. That’s amazing.

Leonard: Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.

(Jacob puts his arms around Joyce and Leonard.)

Jacob: All three of us.

(Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob giggle. Jerry stares at them, confused and uncomfortable.)

Jerry: …Cool… Eggnog?

Jacob: Now we are talkin’! This man’s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?

(All laugh. Rick enters and starts laughing with the rest.)

Rick: Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there.

Jacob: Merry Christmas, man.

Rick: Morty! A moment of your time?

[Trans. Rick’s garage]

(Ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. He’s naked besides a towel over his genitals and his Santa hat.)

Rick: He’s in bad shape, Morty.

Morty: Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?

Rick: Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I’m sittin’ here trying to save the guy’s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He’ll know what’s goin’ on.

Morty: *extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?

Rick: In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head*

Morty: Ruben… Minnesota?

Rick: Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don’t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.

(Rick sets Morty under the shrink ray.)

Morty: W-What proc—

(Rick activates the shrink ray and Morty shrieks as he's shrunk down to a microscopic size. Rick picks up the container Morty shrank into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into Ruben’s chest. Just then, Beth enters the garage.)

Beth: Hey Dad, where's Morty?

Rick: He's busy.

(Trans. Int. Ruben's body)

(Morty continues screaming as he is injected into the body in a stream of pink fluid. He lands on something soft and abruptly stops shouting.)

Rick (through Morty’s earpiece): Morty, can you hear me? Head North!

Morty: Rick… Where am I?

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.

Morty (through Rick’s earpiece): The entrance to what?

Rick: Welcome, Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty gasps.) …to Anatomy Park!

(The view pans to show an amusement park with a large Anatomy Park sign and various attractions and exhibits.)

Rick: It’s a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn’t cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.

Morty: Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?

Rick: You got a problem with that last one, Morty?

Morty: Huh? No, no, I’m just reading them out loud in the order I’m seeing them.

Rick: Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I’m still a little defensive. Let’s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I’m picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.

[Trans. Anatomy Park.]

Rick: Proceed to the liver.

(Following a sign posting directions, Morty hurries off in the direction of the ‘Haunted Liver,’ taking a shuttle to ‘Lower Abdomenland’.)

Automated voice: Arriving at ‘Liver’.

Morty: *stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!

Automated voice: Mind the gap.

(Morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area with flickering lights.)

Morty: It’s really scary in here, Rick.

Rick: Liver’s under maintenance. Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. Don’t judge. You don’t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great.

[Trans. Int. Haunted Liver]

(Morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. An animatronic wolf suddenly springs up behind him.)

Morty: OOOOHHH! Rick, it’s a monster!

Rick: No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf.

(A hand reaches from around the corner and a large, muscular man with a thick accent grips Morty by the throat, lifting him up and pinning him to the wall with his forearm.)

Poncho: Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?

Morty: Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!

Dr. Bloom: Poncho! That’s quite enough.

(Dr. Bloom walks into the room. He appears to be a blob of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. Poncho glares, then reluctantly lets Morty fall to the ground.)

Dr. Bloom: Morty, that’s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is Roger and Annie.

Morty: *staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh…

Dr. Bloom: And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

(A speaker apparatus emerges from Morty’s helmet. Rick speaks through it.)

Rick: Hey Bloom, it’s Rick. What the hell’s goin’ on here?

Dr. Bloom: I don’t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I’m afraid the exhibits are unlocked.

(Rick’s speaker retreats into Morty’s helmet.)

Morty: Exhibits?

[Trans. Ext. Haunted Liver]

Dr. Bloom: Anatomy Park’s greatest attraction, young man, isn’t the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.

Rick: Watch it.

Dr. Bloom: It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity’s most noble and ferocious diseases.

Morty: Diseases?!

(There’s a distant roaring noise.)

Poncho: Hey Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living museum is officially a wild safari!

(Poncho begins shooting at Hepatitis A.)

Roger: Hepatitis A! Run!

(The entire group screams and flees.)

[Trans. Dining room]

(The Smith family, sans Rick and Morty, are seated for dinner with Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob.)

Jacob: Oh… *leans over and wipes some food from Joyce’s mouth with a napkin* The food goes in your mouth, girl!

(All laugh, but Jerry’s laugh is forced.)

Jerry: Aha… I’m sorry Jacob, I guess I’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?

Joyce: We can go into detail later, son.

Leonard: Now wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. Let’s all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry’s smile becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.

Jerry: Dad, please, what are you saying?

Beth: Whatever it is, it’s beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you.

Jerry: Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say Jacob is your lover.

Leonard: No no no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother’s lover. (Jerry again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.

(Joyce kisses Leonard’s cheek and the two hold hands, looking at each other fondly.)

Jacob: Oh… *reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*

(Summer and Beth smile. Jerry stares, at a loss for words.)

Jacob: Jerry, this ham’s got to be all you, right? It’s in-cred-i-ble.

Summer: *smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad.

(Jerry appears more despondent than ever.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(Poncho continues shooting at Hepatitis A.)

Poncho: AHHHHHH!

(The whole group rushes through a door before entering a code and shutting it.)

Dr. Bloom: Hepatitis won’t follow us into the respiratory system!

(They enter to a set of doors under a sign reading ‘Alveoli Forest’. Roger examines a meter near the door.)

Roger: That’s strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.

Dr. Bloom: So the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. That’s why security is offline.

Morty: W-Well, I guess we better check it out.

(The group passes through the doors. As the doors are closing, Alexander, dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes through.)

Alexander: Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*

Dr. Bloom: *points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!

(Alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head back on. The whole group examines the area.)

Roger: If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.

Morty: *raises his hand* I’ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh…

(Morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and clings to it.)

Poncho: Don’t be a hero, kid.

Morty: I’m not. I’m doin’ it because it’s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*

Poncho: *cocks his gun* We shouldn’t be here.

Dr. Bloom: Whatever you do, don’t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life’s work.

(Annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.)

Annie: Ah!

Dr. Bloom: It’s alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!

Morty: Whoa! *grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!

(Tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. He lets go of the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.)

Morty: Oh! What are those things?!

Dr. Bloom: Tuberculosis, coming in fast!

Poncho: *raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!

Dr. Bloom: *grabs Poncho’s arm* No! Do you know what you’ve done?!

[Trans. Garage]

(Ruben coughs.)

[Trans. Lungs]

(The force of the cough lifts the whole group off the ground, then they fall back down.)

Dr. Bloom: Get to the digestive tract! He’s coughing!

(The group starts running.)

[Trans. Garage]

(Ruben coughs several times again.)

[Trans. Lungs]

(The group all manages to push through besides Alexander. Morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. Morty grabs a frond and reaches for Alexander’s hand.)

Alexander: Waaaah! Don’t let me die!

[Trans. Garage]

(Rick looks down over Ruben’s mouth.)

Rick: Just take a deep breath, Ruben.

(Ruben inhales deeply.)

[Trans. Lungs]

Morty: You’re not gonna die! What’s your name?

Alexander: My name is… *his hand slips from Morty’s and he’s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!

(Alexander’s skin and soft tissue are peeled off as Ruben coughs into Rick’s face, getting some spittle, including Alexander, on Rick’s forehead.)

(The group, minus the now-dead Alexander, escape the respiratory system. Morty presses the speaker on his helmet.)

Morty: Rick! Ruben’s got tuberculosis!

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I’ll just cure it, and then—

(Ruben’s heart monitor flatlines. Rick tosses the syringe over his shoulder.)

Rick: Okay. Well I can’t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You’re trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

Rick: —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I’m biased, but, I think it’s great, Morty.

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don’t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I’m just saying, if that becomes impossible—

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The group listens to Rick, all looking glum.)

Rick: —please, you gotta treat yourself.

(The group is headed to the digestive tract.)

Morty: Geez, what’s that horrible smell?

Dr. Bloom: You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I’m kidding. (As he speaks, Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed.

Morty: Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!

Dr. Bloom: The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There’s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.

Morty: Everybody! Get to the colon!

Poncho: Now I’m takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!

(As they walk, Dr. Bloom speaks privately with Morty.)

Dr. Bloom: Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.

Roger: Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.

(Morty slows to walk beside Annie.)

Morty: Hey, just so you know, I-I’m actually fourteen. So, you know…

Annie: What?

Morty: Not twelve.

Annie: Okay.

Morty: Because he just said I was twelve.

Annie: Oh. Good for you.

(She walks ahead of him.)

Rick (through speaker): Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.

Morty: *slumps forward* Nnn…

[Trans. Small intestine]

(The group travel down the small intestine in a raft, surrounded by animatronics singing ‘It’s a Small, Small Intestine.’)

Animatronics: *singing* It’s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It’s a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It’s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It’s a small, small intestine!

Roger: It goes on like this for miles…

Dr. Bloom: *excitedly* And then we get to the large intestine!

(A low rumbling can be heard.)

Poncho: Shh. *shines flashlight* I hear something.

(Gonorrhea rises up from the river of waste.)

Dr. Bloom: *whispers* Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move.

(Gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.)

Dr. Bloom: Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.

(Poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire, Gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. They swim to the ‘shore’ on the side of the intestine.)

Annie: We’re sitting ducks!

Morty: Doc! Didn’t you say the body was filling up with gas?

Dr. Bloom: Yes. Why?

Poncho: Kid! You’re a genius! *pulls out a match*

Dr. Bloom: Are you mad?!

Morty: *grabs Annie’s hand* Everybody! In here!

(They all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining. Poncho lights the match.)

Poncho: Hey Gonorrhea! How’s this for a burning sensation?

(He throws the match towards the disease, where it ignites the gas and causes an explosion. Gonorrhea falls down, dead. Annie hugs Morty, who laughs.)

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Leonard, Summer, Joyce, Jacob, Beth, and Jerry sit in a semicircle on the carpet. Jerry scowls and slumps. Leonard is playing a set of bongos while Summer sings.)

Summer: *singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!

Leonard: Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.

Summer: Christmas drums being played by a boy!

(Beth is clapping along when she notices Jerry sulking. She puts an arm around him.)

Beth: Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.

Jerry: I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I’m being punished for taking your iPad.

Beth: What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I’m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let’s just be here.

(Ethan walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets himself into the house.)

Ethan: Ugh… Summer!

Summer: *stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?

Ethan: I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!

Summer: I don’t have my phone! I’m doing a human holiday!

Ethan: Did you even consider how that might make me feel?

Summer: How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!

Jerry: *stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?

Ethan: Yeah, do you, Summer?

Summer: I don’t know Ethan, do I?

Jacob: *stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer’s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.

(Jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The group runs through another metal security door and hurry down a platform to a growth ray.)

Roger: I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we’ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben’s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.

(Something roars in the distance, causing the area to rumble.)

Poncho: What the hell is that?

Dr. Bloom: The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.

(The dam is clearly close to giving way. Roger keeps working to get the growth ray active.)

Roger: Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!

(Morty notices a strange, black creature in Poncho’s backpack.)

Morty: Poncho? What is this in your backpack?

(Poncho turns around to face Morty, giving Dr. Bloom a view of the creature.)

Dr. Bloom: That’s bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?

(Poncho grabs hold of Annie and holds a knife to her throat. Annie gasps and tries to kick free.)

Poncho: Everybody get back!

Dr. Bloom: Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?

Poncho: *laughs* That’s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I’ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—

Morty: AHHHHH!!!

(Morty leaps up and grabs onto Poncho’s helmet, allowing Annie to escape. He punches Poncho repeatedly before Poncho pulls him off his face and throws him to the ground, where Roger helps him up. Poncho laughs evilly, but stops short when Bubonic Plague bites his shoulder.)

Poncho: Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!

(The four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his death. Just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.)

Annie: You guys!

Roger: It’s gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck!

(Morty holds Annie back as she makes to help Roger.)

Annie: No!

Roger: This is okay! It’s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you can—

(Just then, the dam bursts, drowning Roger in Ruben’s excrement.)

Annie: No!

(Dr. Bloom seals the door to the chamber and Annie hugs Morty, distraught and crying.)

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Leonard, Joyce, and Beth sit on the chair and sofa, Jerry and Summer stand, and Jacob kneels with Ethan in the center of the room.)

Jacob: Let me ask you something Ethan. Where’s the anger coming from, man?

Ethan: From Summer being a total bitch!

(Jacob takes hold of Ethan’s cheeks and forces him to make eye contact.)

Jacob: Where’s the anger coming from?

Ethan: …My brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can’t… I can’t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I’m… m-made me a girl!

(Jacob helps Ethan up to his feet.)

Jacob: He didn’t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to her. Brand new.

(Ethan walks over to Summer.)

Ethan: Come here right now!

Summer: Oh my god, I’m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!

Ethan: I love you so much.

(The two begin making out. Everyone claps besides Jerry.)

Jerry: Um…

Joyce: You did it again, cubby. Come here.

(Joyce and Jacob begin to kiss. Jerry looks to the easy chair to see Leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a Superman costume underneath.)

Jerry: No! Stop! I hate this!

(Beth, Joyce, and Jacob glare at him.)

Joyce: Well, Christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son.

Jerry: Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.

(He walks out. Summer and Ethan and Joyce and Jacob continue kissing.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The three survivors are in a small theater where an animatronic Ruben gives a presentation. Morty and Annie have their helmets off and are making out, and Dr. Bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.)

Animatronic Ruben: My name’s Ruben Ridley. You’re inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I’ll be inside all of you.

(Dr. Bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream, probably due to his semi-aqueous form.)

Animatronic Ruben: My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.

(The animatronic sparks, then goes limp.)

Annie: *whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want…

Rick (through speaker): Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (Annie and Morty both look at Morty’s helmet, startled.)

[Trans. Garage]

(Rick is working on a computer, still talking to Morty through his headset.)

Rick: I’m trying to concentrate.

(Jerry wanders to the door.)

Jerry: Ah, Rick?

Rick: *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry.

Jerry: *enters anyway* I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben’s corpse* Right now, you’re my sanest relative.

(Rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.)

Rick: Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(Annie is in Morty’s lap.)

Morty: Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.

Rick (through speaker): Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben’s left nipple!

(The area begins to rumble and cave in. Morty lifts Annie off his lap and both put on their helmets.)

Morty: We need to get to the left nipple!

Dr. Bloom: The body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the ‘ceiling’.) The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It’s connected to the skeletal system. That’s why we call it the Bone Train. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?

Annie: If it’ll get us out of here.

Dr. Bloom: How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?

Morty: Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let’s go.

[Trans. Garage]

(Jerry looks on as Rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into an incision on Ruben’s abdomen. He takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.)

Jerry: Well, I can see that you’re busy… Merry Christmas, Rick.

(Rick lifts Ruben’s corpse from the table and heads out to the car, dumping Ruben’s body inside.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park: the Bone Train]

Dr. Bloom: There’s no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.

(Morty and Annie glance at each other, then look back at Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom glances at each of the teenagers. Morty and Annie continue staring at him.)

Morty: …Uh, well…

Dr. Bloom: No, you’re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on.

(Something approaches the group from a nearby set of stairs.)

Annie: *points* What the hell is that?

Dr. Bloom: E. coli outbreak. Hurry!

(Morty and Annie jump into the shuttle as E. coli swarm the area. Dr. Bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.)

Dr. Bloom: Oh wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!

(As the train speeds down the track, some of the E. coli have attached themselves to the vehicle. One smashes the window of the train door and sticks its head inside.)

Annie: They’re chewing through the doors!

Morty: Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!

[Trans. Earth’s orbit]

(Rick flies his spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere.)

Rick: I’m almost there, Morty!

(Rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in Ruben’s abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase Ruben to an enormous size—large enough to make Morty and Annie their normal sizes again, but still inside him.)

[Trans. Earth]

(Various people across America stop what they’re doing and look at the sky as Ruben’s huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.)

Reporter: Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?

(As Tom speaks, Ruben’s terrifyingly enormous face floats overhead.)

Tom: Well, his eyes aren’t twinkling, and his dimples aren’t merry, but I’m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!

Reporter: Thank you, Tom. Let’s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.

(Ruben’s poorly kept toes hover in the background while Eric speaks.)

Eric: We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man’s size! And you know what they say about that!

Reporter: Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.

[Trans. Rocky Mountains]

(A lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up, screams, and runs away.)

[Trans. Earth’s orbit]

(Rick flies his ship toward the nipple.)

[Trans. Bone Train]

(E. coli continue trying to break in, with Morty beating them away with a fire extinguisher. Running up to the front of the train, he and Annie see that Hepatitis A is has damaged the track.)

Morty: Oh my god, the track!

Annie: It’s Hepatitis A!

(As Morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the track and straight through some of Ruben’s soft tissue, bursting into the nipple. The train hits a bump, throwing Morty and Annie out. They look up and gasp.)

Annie: The nipple hole…

(Through the nipple hole, they’re able to see Earth as the sun peeks over the horizon.)

Morty: It’s beautiful…

(Suddenly, there’s a crash behind them. Hepatitis A bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards Morty and Annie.)

Annie: Aw no!

(The two run, and just as Hepatitis A is about to catch them, Hepatitis C snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.)

Annie: Whoa! It’s Hepatitis C!

(Hepatitis C gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away with its kill in its mouth.)

Morty: Um… We… Did we have some sort of relationship with him?

Annie: I… think they’re just like that? I think they’re just good guys.

Morty: Oh. Huh.

(Rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it behind them. Morty and Annie climb inside.)

Rick: Where’s Dr. Bloom?

Morty: Sorry Rick… He’s dead…

Rick: Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!

(Rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from Ruben’s corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood and gore in all directions.)

[Trans. Smith residence]

(Joyce, Leonard, Jacob, Beth, Summer, and Ethan all bundle up to go sledding.)

Beth: Jerry doesn’t know what he’s missing.

Jacob: He’ll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.

Beth: I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don’t know if our marriage will—

(Beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding glass doors. The whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the sky.)

Summer: It’s raining blood!

Jacob: Oh, shit. find Jerry!

Beth: Oh god.

[Trans. Jerry’s den]

(Blood is raining on the window there as well. Jerry is sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.)

Beth: Jerry!

Jerry: *stands and hugs her* It’s alright! The TV says there’s nothing to worry about.

Reporter (on TV): The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.

(Family sighs in relief.)

Summer: Dad, can I have my phone back?

Jerry: Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It’ll help you relax.

Jacob: This is nice.

Jerry: Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.

Summer: No we didn’t, Dad. No we didn’t.

[Trans. Smith house]

(It’s no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of Ruben are everywhere as Rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.)

Rick: Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.

Annie: Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom’s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!

Rick: What about Pirates of the Pancreas…?

Annie: I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.

Rick: Booyah! Hold your breath!

(Annie is already standing under the shrink ray as Rick pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to Morty’s chagrin.)

Morty: Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!

(Rick pockets the container holding Annie.)

Rick: Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina.

Morty: W-What’s wrong with that? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!

Rick: C’mon. Let’s get some stuffing, I’m starving.

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Beth, Leonard, Summer, and Ethan sit on the couch, Jacob sits in the easy chair with Joyce in his lap, and Jerry sits on the carpet. All are staring at handheld electronics as Rick and Morty enter the room.)

Rick: Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?

(Jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.)

[End Credits roll]

[Trans. Rick’s garage]

Annie (through speaker phone): Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?

Rick: Loud and clear, Annie.

Annie: Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—

Alejandro: Hey Rick.

Annie: Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media.

Rick: Hey everybody.

All: Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin'. (etc.)

Annie: So. Pirates of the Pancreas.

Rick: Yeah, talk to me.

Alejandro: Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” (Rick begins to look agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—

(Rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up on the group call. Behind him, Ethan lies on a table.)

Ethan: So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?

Rick: Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They’re inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.

Ethan: … Cool. And who pays me?

(Open Ext. Smith residence.)

(Rick is dissecting a rat.)

Rick: T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.

Morty: Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?

Rick: Oh, yes, Morty. It’s almost unbelievable, isn’t it?

Morty: Yeah, you know? There’s something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.

Rick: Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.

Morty: Wh… convincing?

Rick: Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!

Morty: Uhh, okay.

Beth: *robotic* I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. (Beth drives away.)

Morty: What’s with Mom?

Rick: Oh, what’s with Mom? So, you’re saying that she’s acting weird? How soph-*burp*-isticated. Careful, guys. You’re gonna burn out the CPU with this one.

Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick? You’re acting weird, too.

Rick: Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”

Morty: Alright, well I’ll see you after school. (Walks into the side of the garage.) Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I’m all right. I’m okay.

[Trans. Morty’s math class]

Mr. Goldenfold: Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? (Students whisper.) Morty?

Morty: Uh, me?

Mr. Goldenfold: What is 5 x 9?

Morty: Um, you know, it’s, uh, at least 40.

(Students gasp.)

Mr. Goldenfold: Morty, that’s exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.

(Students cheer.)

Jessica: Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

Mr. Goldenfold: Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!

Rick: *spying from outside* Interesting…

Morty: W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?

Student: Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?

Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, that’s a good question.

Morty: Concentrated huh?

Mr. Goldenfold: Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?

Morty: Uhhh…

Jessica: Come on, Morty. Isn’t your grandpa, like, a scientist?

Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn’t go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.

Jessica: I bet you’ve seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.

Morty: Uh, y-you will?

Mr. Goldenfold: Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.

Rick: *kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There’s a family emergency.

(Rick grabs Morty by one arm. Mr. Goldenfold grabs the other.)

Mr. Goldenfold: Stop right there! If he leaves, I’m giving him an F!

Rick: He doesn’t care.

Morty: Aw, man! (Rick drags him to the locker room.) Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!

Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty.

Morty: What?!

Rick: Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.

Morty: Ugh! I’m gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*

Rick: Morty, that’s not class. T-t-t-that wasn’t your teacher. This isn’t your school. This entire world is not the world. We’re inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.

Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?

Rick: It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn’t say so until we got in the shower. They won’t monitor us in here.

Morty: Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!

Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy’s most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it’s lucky for us they’re also really uncomfortable with nudity.

Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.

Rick: I can’t let you do that, Morty.

(Rick grabs Morty’s clothes and they begin fighting over them.)

Morty: Give it to me!

Rick: No! You give it to me!

Morty: G-g-give it!

Rick: Morty, come on! Morty!

Morty: No, Rick!

[View of simulated world expands out to reveal they’re in an enormous spacecraft.]

[Trans. Zigerion control room]

(Zigerions groan and look away from the monitors with disgust.)

Zigerion 1: Oh, god, sir! They’re still naked! Ugh.

Prince Nebulon: Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they’re not!

Zigerion 1: I think we should make Kevin look, sir.

Kevin: What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?

Stu: Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.

Prince Nebulon: If there’s a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.

Stu: Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. (Jerry appears on a large screen.) There’s another real human in the simulator.

Jerry: Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.

Prince Nebulon: How did this happen?! Where’s the Abductions Department?

Zigerion 2: Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.

Zigerion 3: Don’t put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven’t been simulated!

Kevin: Well, Simulations doesn’t simulate anybody that’s been abducted, so—

Prince Nebulon: Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one’s fault. Oh, okay. I’m sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There’s still another human in here! Who is he?

Stu: Rick’s son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn’t noticed he’s in a simulation.

Prince Nebulon: *sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we’ll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.

[Trans. Jerry’s car]

Jerry: *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It’s just a pitch. Gotta relax.

(He turns on the radio.)

Radio: This is earth radio. And now, here’s…human music.

(Repetitive rhythmic beeping.)

Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*

[Pan out to see Jerry’s sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to Rick and Morty’s.]

(Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.)

Morty: Rick!

Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It’s the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You’d have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy’s putting a bun between two hot dogs.

Morty: I don’t know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.

Rick: Well, look at that old lady. She’s, she’s walking a cat on a leash.

Morty: Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.

Rick: Look, I-I-I don’t wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She’s an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?

(A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.)

Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

Rick: Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven’t seen that somewhere in real life before?

Morty: No, no. I haven’t seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?

Rick: You’re missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.

Morty: So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?

Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you’d been paying attention.

(Siren wails. Ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.)

Paramedic: We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he’ll die!

(Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.)

Morty: Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.

Rick: Yeah, it’s a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they’re gonna pay!

Morty: Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?

Rick: We’ll scam the scammers, Morty. And we’re gonna take them for everything they’ve got.

[Trans. Ext. Ad agency]

(Trees flicker with a static noise)

Jerry: National Apple Farmers of America…

[Trans. Int. Ad agency]

Jerry: Welcome to our ad agency. I’m Jerry Smith. (Audience stares blankly.) Alright. I’ll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we’re hungry. (Audience stares blankly.) With that, I give you your new slogan! (Flips paper to reveal sign saying “Hungry for Apples?” Audience continues staring.) Well, say something! Do you like it?

Mr. Marklevitz: Yes.

Jerry: You do?

All: Yes.

Jerry: So I sold it? I sold the idea?

All: Yes.

Jerry: Oh my god! Thank you!

All: *shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You’re welcome.

[Trans. Ext. Ad agency]

(“Baker Street” plays as Jerry slides down a handrail.)

Jerry: Hey! I just sold my first pitch!

Old man: Slow down!

Woman: Lookin’ good.

Mailman: My man!

(Jerry dials on his cellphone. As he walks, he passes the same three people repeatedly.)

Simulation Beth: (at Simulation Smith house) *answers phone* Hello.

Jerry: Guess who just sold the apples campaign.

Simulation Beth: Who just sold the apples campaign?

Jerry: Me! I guess it wasn’t a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someone was wrong.

Simulation Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.

Simulation Beth: Okay.

Jerry: Wait, really?

Simulation Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I’m going to make love to my wife!

Woman: Lookin’ good.

Old man: Slow down!

Mailman: My man! *glitches into a tree*

[Trans. Backstage]

(Rick is decked out in chains and adjusts his clothes to look more disheveled.)

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don’t know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Rick: Morty, relax. It’s just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You’re gonna be fine. (Lowers Morty’s pants slightly and puts a hat on him.) Just follow my lead. (Rick and Morty fist bump.) Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

[Trans. Stage in park]

(Hip-hop beat plays. Crowd cheers.)

Rick: Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don’t think we can perform our new song, "The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter," for a crowd this tiny.

Morty: You got that right, Rick.

(Hordes of people appear from all directions and congregate in the park.)

Rick: Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah! (Crowd cheers.) All the ladies say, "yeah!" (Ladies cheer.) Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! (People start glitching.)

[Trans. Smith house]

Jerry: *kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don’t move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!

[Trans. Park]

Rick: Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "L" who isn’t Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten! (Simulation freezes. Rick and Morty jump offstage.) Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!

[Trans. Ext. Smith house.]

Jerry: Yeah! You like that? Now who’s unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!

[Trans. Beth and Jerry’s bedroom.]

(Jerry lies in bed beside Beth, who is frozen in place.)

Jerry: Oh, my god. That’s the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. It’s… it’s too good. I don’t deserve this, Beth. I’m a fraud.

[Trans. Rick and Morty running through frozen simulation.]

Morty: Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?

Rick: Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it’s frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*

Morty: Holy crap!

Rick: Come on, Morty.

Morty: *jumps off edge*

[Trans. Control room]

Zigerion: Sir, they’re over the edge.

Prince Nebulon: Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!

[Trans. Corridor in spacecraft]

Rick: Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That’s how we’re gonna scam these idiots.

Morty: So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you’re so much smarter than them?

Rick: It’s an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I’m one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren’t good at much, but they’re really good at making these chips.

Morty: I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.

Rick: Don’t worry about it, Morty. There’s plenty of them, you little goofball. (Both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!

Rick: Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

(They sneak towards the escape pods. Rick throws a chip and distracts the guards while they steal a pod and fly away.)

Morty: Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.

Rick: Totes malotes, dawg.

Morty: Just kind of hard to believe, you know?

Rick: Believe it, Morty. And once again, I’m flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.

[Trans. Jerry’s boss’s office]

Jerry: Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let’s face it. "Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?" It’s almost identical.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I’ll just pack up my desk.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don’t have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There’s not even a single word in "Hungry for Apples" that’s shared by "Got milk?" It’s a completely different slogan. It’s different! And I shouldn’t be fired. I should be promoted!

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it’s the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Could we nominate me?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Holy crap!

(Jerry runs out. Mr. Marklevitz glitches.)

[Trans. Ext. Smith house]

(Rick and Morty get out of the escape pod and head into the garage with the chips.)

Rick: Get in, Morty. I’m gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (Keypad beeps.) Huh. I thought I entered the code right. (Keypad beeps.)

(Second level simulation vanishes.)

Prince Nebulon: Well, what’s this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you’re inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You’re still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!

Cynthia: Sir, the, uh, doctor’s appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—

Prince Nebulon: Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.

Rick: Uhh…

Prince Nebulon: We’ve known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!

Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!

Prince Nebulon: That is why you’re never getting home. Get them!

(Guards try to grab Rick and Morty. Rick pulls down Morty’s pants and all the Zigerions back away in disgust.)

Rick: RUN MORTY!

(Morty pulls up his pants. They run through the spacecraft and are chased by Zigerions.)

Morty: Oh my god!

[Trans. Appley Awards]

Jerry: I got to tell you, this morning, I didn’t even know this award existed. Now I’m holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it’s, it’s more meaningful than that.

Mailman: My man!

Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!

(Everyone glitches into the mailman.)

Mailmen: My my my my man!

(Simulation continues glitching badly.)

Jerry: Aah! What the hell?! (Appley award glitches out of existence.) No.

(Rick and Morty run into the room.)

Rick: Jerry?!

Morty: Dad!

Rick: What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don’t have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*

Jerry: *sobbing* No!

(Chase continues. The three make it onto a spaceship.)

Rick: Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.

Morty: Oh, man! They’re hot on our tail, Rick!

Rick: I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

Morty: Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.

Morty: Whoa! It’s all here, Rick!

Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.

Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.

Rick: Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There’s no time!

Morty: *freezes up*

Rick: Oh, no.

(Simulation breaks down...again.)

Jerry: What the…?

Rick: No!

Prince Nebulon: *laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You’re inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!

Rick: You simulated my grandson’s genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Zigerion 1: Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

Kevin: You said you weren’t gonna tell anyone! I’m never gonna live this down, am I?

Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?

Zigerion 1: I don’t know. Can you?

Prince Nebulon: Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I’m done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He’s trying to figure out if He’s in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You’re not. *walks back* Or are you? (Rick and Jerry leave.) *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don’t have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.

Cynthia: Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

Prince Nebulon: *loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.

[Trans. Shuttle to Earth]

Rick: Hey, Jerry, don’t worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you’re one of us.

Rick: Maybe you’re right, Jerry. Maybe you’re right.

[Trans. Zigerion space craft, control room]

(The Zigerions are celebrating their victory with a party.)

Prince Nebulon: All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn’t ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient…

(Zigerion spacecraft explodes.)

[Trans. Shuttle to Earth]

(Jerry looks behind them, shocked.)

Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?

Rick: Why don’t you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can’t. They blew up.

(“Baker Street” plays. Rick vocalizes the saxophone part.)

Post-Credit Scene

[Trans. Int. Ad agency]

(Jerry pitches “Hungry for Apples” in reality.)

Jerry: So… What do you think?

Mr. Marklevitz: You’re fired.

Jerry: Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

Mr. Marklevitz: Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.

(Jerry hangs his head and leaves.)

Mr. Marklevitz: Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

[Trans. Morty’s bedroom]

Rick: Hey, Morty.

Morty: What?

Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?

Rick: Y-y-you’re a good kid, Morty. Y-you’re a real l-little c-character, Morty.

Morty: Oh, boy.

Rick: You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You’re my little friend, aren’t you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You’re a real true hero out in the field. You’re a... You’re a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?

Morty: Have you been drinking, Rick?

Rick: I really appreciate you, Morty.

Morty: O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick

Rick: *suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty’s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

Morty: No! No! No!

Rick: You little son of a bitch!

Morty: *terrified, gasps*

(Rick lowers the knife)

Rick: I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you’re a good… You’re a good kid, Morty.

Morty: Geez!

Rick: Y-you’re a good… You’re a good kid. *passes out*

Morty: Oh my god!

Rick: *snores*

Morty: W-w-what the hell? What a life.

[Open Ext. Damaged space station, likely in another dimension]

(The sky is purple and tumultuous as the sounds of Rick and Morty running and panting are heard.)

[Trans. Int. Space station]

(Rick and Morty run through the abandoned station, pursued by evil clones of Jerry, Beth, and Summer.)

Rick: Run!

Jerry, Beth, and Summer: *incoherent zombie noises*

(The three clones tackle Rick, knocking a device from his hand. Morty stands by, unsure of what to do.)

Rick: Morty, do it! Hit the button now!

Morty: I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!

Rick: *holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!

(Beth’s clone leaves Rick and approaches Morty, panting viciously until she gets close, and she seemingly becomes her normal self again.)

Beth: Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart.

Morty: Ohhhh…

(Morty hesitates a second longer before darting past Beth. He glances up at the clones, then covers his eyes as he hits a button on the wall, creating an energy field that destroys the clones, whose faces seem to melt. Morty watches, horrified. As soon as they’re gone, Rick jumps to his feet and grabs the device that absorbed the spirits, apparently unbothered by the entire event.)

Rick: Good work, Morty.

(He creates a portal and jumps through.)

[Trans. Garage]

(Rick and Morty leap through the other end of the portal back to the Smith residence.)

Rick: *holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!

(Screen pans out to show that Morty is vomiting in the corner. Rick glances at him and puts the box away.)

Rick: You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.

Morty: I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were!

Rick: I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.

Morty: Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!

(Morty turns and starts to walk out of the garage.)

Rick: Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty’s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!

Morty: *pushes Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!

Rick: Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how simple and fun it is.

Morty: *suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?

Rick: Okay, fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.

Morty: Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!

Rick: Every 10th.

Morty: Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.

Beth: Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.

Rick: Washing dishes?

Beth: No. The opposite. Can you fix it?

Summer: Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?

Rick: Yeah just don't do it.

Summer: Grandpa!

Jerry: Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?

Rick: Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family.

Morty: Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

Rick: Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.

(meeseeks spawns)

Meeseeks: I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Rick: You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.

Meeseeks: Yes, siree!

(Meeseeks grabs mayonnaise jar as rick explains.)

Rick: The Meeseeks fulfills the request.

(Meeseeks opens jar and hands to jerry.)

Meeseeks: All done!

Jerry: [amazed] Wow!

Rick: And then it stops existing.

(Meeseek vanishes into particles in air.)

Summer: Oh, my God, he exploded!

Rick: Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods.

Morty: All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!

(Beth, Jerry and Summer in the livingroom)

Beth: So many possibilities.

Summer: My mind is racing.

Jerry: If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.

(Summer spawns a meeseek)

Meeseeks: I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Summer: I want to be popular at school!

Meeseeks: Ooh, okay!

Jerry: Summer, what did I just-

(Beth spawns a meeseek)

Meeseeks 2: Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Beth: I want I want to be a more complete woman!

Jerry: Beth!

Meeseeks 2: Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

Jerry: You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple."

(Jerry spawns a meeseeks)

Meeseeks 3: Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Jerry: Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.

Meeseeks 3: Ooh, yeah! Can do!

Jerry: Nailed it.

(Cut to Rick and Morty in a poor village somewhere in the universe. It looks like a place from the 1700's)

Rick: God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?

Morty: Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?

Rick: Can't wait.

(Morty stands on something tall to speak to the people)

Morty: Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!

Rick: Oh, my God, so embarrassing.

Villager (man): At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures!

Morty: You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!

Rick: Yeah. Beginner's luck.

(Cut to Meeseeks 1 speaking to the students of Summer's school in the gym)

Meeseeks 1: In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you!

Principal Gene V.: Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- (Meeseeks 1 stops existing)- No, I'll get your info from Summer.

(Cut to Beth and Meeseeks 2 at a restaurant sitting outside)

Beth: I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...-(Meeseeks 2 stares attentively)- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon.

Meeseeks 2: She's still there, Beth.

Beth: Well, her waistline isn't.

Meeseeks 2: Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

Beth: You're saying I should leave Jerry. (Beth starts to cry) I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.

(Meeseeks 2 stops existing as Beth leans in to kiss him)

Waiter (man): More wine?

Beth: I think I've had enough.

(Cut to Jerry at a golf course with Meeseeks 3)

Meeseeks 3: Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.

Jerry: Yeah, yeah. I got it.

(Jerry misses the ball completely)

Meeseeks 3: That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down.

Jerry: Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?

Meeseeks 3: Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.

Jerry: You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up.

Meeseeks 3 (nervous): I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.

Jerry: Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.

Meeseeks 3: No, Jerry, I'm the one who SUCKS! Let me try something.

(Meeseeks 3 spawns in another Meeseek)

Meeseeks 4: I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Meeseeks 3: Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

Meeseeks 4: Hi!

Meeseeks 3: Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?

Meeseeks 4: Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?

Meeseeks 3: Ooh, he's trying!

(Cut to Rick and Morty on a table in a giant building)

Rick: All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?

Morty: Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.

(A giant can be heard walking down the hall)

Rick (sarcastic): Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?

Morty: Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.

Giant: Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

Rick: Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.

Morty: No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.

Giant: I smell the blood of- whoop!(the giant falls and cracks his head open on the table corner before hitting the ground)

Morty: Holy crap.

Rick: Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out.

(A giant woman walks in holding a baby)

Giant woman: Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!

(Cut to Rick and Morty at a giant jail and getting mug shots)

Detective: Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"

Morty: Th-th but that's not how it went down!

Detective: Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that.

Rick: Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun.

(Cut to the Smith dinning room and living room where Jerry is still frustrated, while Summer and Beth look much happier)

Summer: Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.

Beth: The most important love you can receive is from yourself.

(Several meeseeks now fill the livingroom, trying to help)

Meeseek: Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!

Jerry: Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!

Meeseek: Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.

Jerry: Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!

Meeseek: Just try to relax.

Jerry: You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! (Jerry walks to the dinning room) Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through.

Beth: Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.

Jerry: You're kidding me.

Beth: Notice anything different?

Jerry: I'm sorry. Hours?

Summer: Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!

Meeseek: Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird.

(Cut to Rick and Morty in a giant courthouse)

Judge: Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.

Rick (sarcastic): Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

Morty: We're gonna be okay, Rick.

Rick: How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-(the court doors burst open and a giant in a suit walks down the isle.)

Giant Lawyer: Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.

(Murmers of confusion spread throughout the court)

Rick: W-what the hell is he talking about?

Giant Lawyer: They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

Morty: Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!

(Rick and Morty appear outside the courthouse)

Rick: All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?

Morty: Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.

Rick: Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.

Morty: Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.

(They look down the stairs and see that each step is as tall as a large building. The stairs seem to go on forever)

Rick: Oh, boy, Morty.

Morty: Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.

Rick: What do you say, Morty?

Morty: I say give me a hand, sidekick.

(Cut to the Smith livingroom. Dozens of meeseeks fill the room whinning, groaning and desperatly trying to help Jerry.)

NOTE: to make this easier an * will be put next to meeseek everytime a different meeseeks talks.

Jerry: Everybody shut up! Let me try! (Jerry swings and misses again) Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

Beth: I'm going out.

Jerry: Wait. What?

Beth: Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?

Jerry: Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner.

All the Meeseeks: AWWWWWWW!

Jerry: Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.

(Exit Beth and Jerry)

Meeseek: I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!

Meeseek *: We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this?

Meeseek *: 'Cause he roped me into this!

Meeseek *: Well, him over there, he roped me into this!

Meeseek *:Well, he roped me into this!

Meeseek *: Well, what about me? He roped me into this.

Meeseek *: Well, that one over there roped me into this.

Meeseek *: Well, he roped me into this.

(Cut to Rick and Morty climbing down a step like it's a mountian)

Rick: Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.

Morty: All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. (They see an opening in one of the steps) Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.

(Rick and Morty appear in the tavern)

Morty: Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.

(Rick sees a creature staring at him)

Rick: What are you looking at, mother-

Morty: Easy, Rick.

(A strange looking waitress with large boobs greets them at their table)

Waitress: Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.

Rick: Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?

Morty: Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?

Slippery: Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.

Rick: 25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?

Waitress: That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.

Mr. Booby Buyer: Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.

Waitess: It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.

Mr. Booby Buyer: Rats! What a shame.

Rick: Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.

Morty: You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?

Rick: Uh, because it's lame?

Morty: It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!

Rick: Whatever.

(Cut to the Smith livingroom with all the Meeseeks)

Meeseek: It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

Meeseeks *: I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.

Meeseeks 3: Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst.

Meeseeks: Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through!

(A Meeseek spawns in another Meeseek)

New Meeseek: I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Meeseek: Kill him!

New Meeseek: Hisssss! (He attacks another meeseek)

(Cut to Morty in the bathroom)

Mr. Jelly Bean: How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean!

Morty: Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.

Mr. Jelly Bean: Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

Morty: I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.

Mr. Jelly Bean: Well, isn't that what adventures do?

Morty: Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.

Mr. Jelly Bean: Yeah. (He rubs Morty's sholders)

Morty: Okay. Uh. B-bye.

Mr. Jelly Bean: Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!

Morty: Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.

(Mr. Jelly Bean clearly wants to rape Morty)

Mr. Jelly Bean (aggresive): Stop fighting me! Just let this happen!

Morty: Get off of me!

(cut to Rick singing karaoke)

Rick: ♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

(back to Morty, the fighting makes it to a stall)

Morty: Whoo! No! Stop! Please!

Mr. Jelly Bean: Stop being such a tease, you sweet little-

Morty: No! No!

(Morty gets the upper hand and, in a frenzied attack, slams the toilet seat on Mr. Jelly Bean's head until he is knocked out)

(Back at the Smith house even more Meeseeks have spawned and a full out battle has started. However, even the badly hurt Meeseeks cannot die because the have not completed their task)

Meeseek: Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done.

Meeseek *: The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game!

Meeseek: No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game.

All other Meeseeks: Where's he going with this? What's he mean?

Meeseek: When we kill him!

(Loud hooting and joy from the meeseeks crowd)

(Cut to Jerry and Beth at dinner)

Beth: Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.

Jerry: Where would you go?

Beth: I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.

Jerry: Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?

(A loud noise is heard and the glass window breaks with a hoard of Meeseeks angrily storming in)

Jerry: What the heck?

Meeseek: There he is!

Beth: Run, Jerry!

(Beth and Jerry lock themselves in a freezer with a small window in the door)

Meeseek: Come on out, Jerry!

Jerry: Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?

Meeseek: Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

(Cut to Rick at a card table with some other characters)

Card Player: Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?

Rick: Read 'em and weep, fellas! (Morty comes back) Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.

Morty (very stressed): Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over.

Rick: We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!

Morty: Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home.

(Rick sees the badly beaten Mr. Jelly Bean walk out of the bathroom and pieces together what happened)

Rick: Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

Morty: Really?

Rick: Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.

(Outside on the steps)

Slippery: Buckle up! (He starts to take them down)

(Cut back to the freezer)

Meeseek (presumably 3): Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask... (Meeseek grabs a woman) Aah! ...what's your name, ma'am?

Woman: Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!

Jerry: Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?

(Beth takes a stand, tears a pipe off of a rack, and grabs Jerry off the ground)

Beth: Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you.

Meeseek (presumably 3): I'm counting to three, Jerry.

(Jerry, using the pipe, hits a garlic clove into a pot)

Samantha; What the f*** is going on?

All Meeseeks: He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!

(All the Meeseeks stop existing except 1)

Meeseeks: Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?

Samantha: Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!

(Jerry puts some more garlic into a cup)

Meeseek: Ooh, nice! (Stops existing)

Jerry: I think we'll take our food to go.

Owner: No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.

Jerry: Fair enough.

(Rick and Morty return to the village in triumph)

The First Villager: Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!

Rick: Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.

Morty: Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.

Rick: Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.

The First Villager: Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.

(The badly beaten Mr. Jelly Bean is carried to towards them on a thrown)

Morty: Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.

(They portal away, but Rick makes another portal back and sticks an energy pistol through it and shoots Mr. Jelly Bean, splattering him all over the screaming villagers)

(Back at the Smith house)

Jerry: So... You still thinking about taking that trip?

Beth: Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task."

Jerry: Was I one of those guys?

Beth: The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.

Jerry: Well... I got you pregnant.

Beth: Yeah...

Rick: What the hell happened to this place?

Beth: Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible.

Rick: Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.

Beth: Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?

Rick: Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.

Jerry: No. No more boxes.

Rick: What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs! (Everyone laughs) Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.

(After the end credits at the village)

Beth: I don't get it.

Villager 1: Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean's closet. (A box of pictures of many young boys Mr. Jelly Bean molested) We have to tell the people.

Villager 2: Wait. Destroy it. (They set the box on fire) Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.

[Open ext. Harry Herpson High School]

[Trans. int. Harry Herpson High School hallway]

(Morty is standing at his locker.)

Principal Vagina: (over the intercom, while the students talk) Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.

(Morty watches Jessica with her friends at a nearby locker)

Jessica's friend: (to Jessica) Hey.

Morty: Ohhh. Okay, here we go. * walks over to Jessica and her friends* (Nervously) H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.

Jessica: What's up Morty? *sneezes*

Morty: Ugghh

Brad: *butts in* What are you doing?

Morty: Ummm

Brad: Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?

Morty: Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.

Brad: Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!

Jessica: (sarcastically) Gee, thanks, Brad.

(Jessica and Brad walk away)

Brad: I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager.

(Morty stands at the locker alone and looks down in disappointment)

[Trans. ext. The Smith's house]

[Trans. int. The Smith's kitchen]

(Jerry is making a sandwich and talking to Morty at the counter)

Jerry: Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.

Morty: (Plays with a cookie in sadness) You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!

Jerry: Ahhh, well, (gets another jar of sauce out of the cupboard) I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...

Rick: (enters and interrupts Jerry) I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me. (grabs a glass from a cupboard)

Jerry: I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. (points to Morty)

Rick: (grabs ice from out of the freezer)(sarcastically) Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. (gets juice out of the refrigerator) I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.

Jerry: (Angrily) My marriage is fine, thank you.

(Rick walks towards Jerry)

Rick: Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is, (pours juice into the glass) but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.

Morty: Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.

(Rick walks around counter, to Morty)

Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. (exits room, drinking juice)

(Jerry walks next to Morty)

Morty: (In woe) Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. (exits kitchen)

Jerry: Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom. (exits opposite direction)

[Trans. ext. The Smith's house]

[Trans. int. The Smith's garage]

(Rick is working on a machine, on his desk, as Morty enters, in his suit)

Rick: (With his back to Morty) Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? *Morty closes door* I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.

Morty: Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? (walks to Rick at his desk) Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?

Rick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. (points to the shelf)

Morty: (Angrily) YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick. (Rick gets up and grabs a box of supplies from the shelf) I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?

Rick: *sighs* You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass! (grabs some test tubes with yellow liquid and holds one up) Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?

(Morty shakes his head as Rick walks away from the shelf)

Rick: It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain, (sets down the box of objects, opens a hatch in a machine, and pours the oxytocin in) ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta *burps* combine it with some of your DNA.

Morty: Oh well, okay... (zips down his fly)

Rick: A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones. (plucks hair from Morty's head)

Morty: Oww!

(Rick drops the hair in the machine and closes the hatch) (The machine vibrates and makes noises, then pours an orange liquid into a conical flask, much like a coffee machine)

Rick: (grabs the flask containing the orange liquid) Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?

(Rick hands the potion to Morty, and walks away)

Morty: Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick! (walks to the door, but thinks about it and looks back) Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?

Rick: Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.

(Morty leaves the garage as Rick works on the ionic defibulizer some more)

Rick: Ugh, unless she has the flu. (shrugs it off)

*suspense music*

[Trans Beth and Jerry's room]

(Beth is typing on the computer, while Jerry is sadly sitting on their bed)

Jerry: Beth, do you still love me?

Beth: *sighs* Want kinda question is that?

Jerry: The "yes" or "no" kind. *weak laugh of obviousness*

Beth: Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

Jerry: Yess.

Beth: Are you gonna build them?

Jerry: Noo.

Beth: Then what good was the "yes"?

Jerry: (walks to Beth at the computer)(confused) Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?

Beth: (Turns around to Jerry)(Irritated) Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say "no" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?

Jerry: Sort of.

Beth: But I obviously sort of love you, don't I? *alert on Beth's phone* So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more. (looks at her phone) Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.

(Beth gets up and grabs her jacket at the door)

Jerry: This late?

Beth: (puts on her jacket) The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone. (leaves the room, leaving Jerry alone)

Jerry: (In his head)(Progressively angrier) *Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin*

[Trans. ext. Herry Herpson High School, Gymnasium entrance]

(Dressed up students walk inside in pairs, a large banner reads "FLU SEASON DANCE" over the doors)

[Trans int. Flu Season Dance inside Gymnasium]

(Morty happily walks passed many students eating and dancing, a band plays Flu Hatin' Rap in the background)

Band Vocalist / MC Haps: (Background) Flu. Yo, you gotta be aware. Aware about the flu, up in the air. Imma get me a shot and make the flu go away. Flu hatin' rappers just rappin' away. Yo. Yo. Flu hatin' rapper. It's a flu hatin' rap....This is about flu awareness. Gotta be aware of the flu in the airness. Yo, I'm a flu hatin' rapper. My name is MC Haaaaaaaaaaps- Haps Yeah, I'm MC Haps, I'm a flu hatin' rapper, yo......

(Morty sees Jessica and her friends, he takes out a vial of the potion and pours it onto his hand, he then approaches them)

Morty: Hey there, Jessica. (Pretends to trip, wiping the potion on Jessica's arm) Whooa-whoopsie!

(Jessica turns around and becomes infected, falling in love with Morty)

Jessica:(infected) Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight.

Morty: WOW, thanks!

(Jessica pulls Morty close to her breasts)

Jessica:(infected) I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!

Morty: Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! (Brad walks passed with a drink, he overhears)

Brad: (outraged) *spits* Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?(shoves Morty)

Jessica: (Infected) LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK! (pulls Morty away) I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE! *sneezes*

(Jessica sneezes infected bacteria into Brad's mouth) (You can more promptly hear the band's rap as the green spheres of bacteria spread throughout Brad's body, through his blood and nerves)

Brad: (infected) Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry.

Morty: Oh, well, no problem Brad.

Brad: (hugs Morty)(infected) There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special. (squeezes Morty's butt and back)

Morty: (pushes Brad away) Whoa, take it easy!

Jessica: (grabs Morty's left arm)(infected) GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!

Brad: (grabs Morty's right arm)(infected) BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!

(Brad and Jessica quarrel over Morty)

Principal Vagina: (Stops the fight, pulling Brad back, aided with Mr. Goldenfold) That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.

(Principal Vagina and Mr. Goldenfold drag Brad away)

Brad: (disappointment)(infected) Oh, Principal Vagina.

(Jessica takes Morty away, grasping his head)

Jessica: (infected) Never leave me, Morty, NEVER.

(Morty and Jessica hold each other) (Nearby students begin to watch)

Morty: (confused) Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?

Jessica: (infected) Who cares? Just hold me.

(Trans. Principal Vagina and Mr. Goldenfold dragging distraught Brad outside of the gym)

Brad: (infected) LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY! *sneeze, sneeze* (exits the gym)

(Brad sneezes infected bacteria into a nearby punch bowl, then again into a vent) *suspenseful music* Morty!

Jerry: She’s gonna be alone with that guy all night.
Summer: Yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses. It’s not a very romantic setting.
Rick: Well, Summer, there’s always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up.
Maybe Davin’s digging around in herinsides.
Summer: Grandpa, so gross! You’re talking about my mom.
Rick: Well, she’s my daughter, Summer.
I outrank you.
Or family means nothing, in which case don’t play that card.
Jerry: She’s not responding to my texts!
Summer: Careful, dad.
Jealousy turns women off.
Jerry: Well, isn’t that convenient?
Rick: Not for the men they cheat on, no.
Jerry: Okay, I’m… going to go out… for some ice cream. And maybe stop by the hospital… to support my wife… with my confidence.
[Door closes]
Summer: God, grandpa, you’re such a dick.
Rick: I’m sorry, Summer. Your opinion means very little to me. How come you’re not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?
Summer: Screw that. I don’t want to get sick. It’s flu season.
Rick: It is?
Summer: Yeah.
Rick: Uh-oh.
[Hip-hop music plays]
Morty: Please just let this work out.
[Moans] Do it, Morty. Do it.
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!
[Growls]
Morty: Um… can we maybe go somewhere more private?
Jessica, get a hold of yourself!
[Grunts]
You don’t deserve to carry Morty’s genes.
[Rapping]
♪ I love Morty ♪
♪ and I hope Morty loves me ♪ ♪ I’d like to wrap my arms around him ♪ ♪ and feel him inside me ♪
Morty: Oh, crap.
[Indistinct shouting]
Morty!
Rick: Morty, come on!
We got to get you out of here.
You’re not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.
[Both panting] come on, Morty.
We got to get out of here.
Come on.
Morty!
Morty: [wails] are you okay?
Morty: I’m fine!
Oh, good.
If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.
I love you bad, mo-mo!
[All panting]
[indistinct shouting]
Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we’re both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!
Rick: I didn’t realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty.
Morty: What the hell is going on, Rick?
Rick: What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus. It’s gone airborne, Morty.
Morty: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?
Rick: It’s gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up and antidote. It’s based on praying-mantis dna. You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.
I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.
I mean, it’s a whole ritual.
It’s really gruesome and totally opposite.
There’s no love at all.
I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.
It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.
It’ll all be over very shortly.
[Indistinct shouting]
Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn’t ask or anything, but I’m not interested in having s*x with you.
These serums, they don’t work on anybody related to you genetically.
Morty!
[All groaning]
Rick: Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty.
A lot of people don’t get that.
Jerry: [gasps]
[tires screech]
Come on. Are you kidding me?
Hello!
Morty!
You’re not Morty!
Bring us Morty!
[Gun cocks]
Jerry: Nobody’s killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
I had s*x with billy.
But you were already pregnant!
Yeah, so what’s the worst that could happen?
We interrupt "pregnant baby" with breaking news.
Summer: [groans] Come on.
This just in Morty smith’s whereabouts are still unknown.
Summer: What the hell?
The only thing that is known is… how cute he is.
I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.
I love him more than you do, harold!
You wish, you stupid bitch!
Morty’s mine!
Morty’s mine!
Meant to be together!
[Speaking arabic]
Morty!
[Speaking arabic]
[banging on door]
Where is Morty?
Summer: [screams]
[conversing in native language]
Morty: Oh, my god, Rick.
The whole world is infected!
Rick: Yeah, it’s pretty wild how fast that spread.
I’ve really outdone myself.
Morty: Outdone yourself?!
W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick?
This is not okay!
Not only do they all want to have s*x with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!
Rick: Yeah, I don’t know what I was thinking.
Mantises are they opposite of voles?
I mean, obviously, dna’s a little more complicated than that.
You know what, though, Morty?
This right here’s gonna do the tRick, baby.
It’s koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.
Should add up to normal humanity.
Morty: I don’t that doesn’t make any sense, Rick.
How does that add up to normal humanity?
Morty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?
I’m sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?
[Exhales deeply] Well, I’m glad we saved all those horses, but I’m almost sorry we’re finished.
Beth: Yes, it’s satisfying work.
Unh-unh-unh, it’s, uh it’s more than the work.
I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world.
It’s the only time I can really think… and feel.
[Slow music plays]
Beth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing?
I’m playing african dream pop.
What do youdo after a long night?
[Click]
Beth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I’d better get going.
Um, Jerry’s been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.
Beth…
Beth: What is it, davin?
Just once, I’d like to know [sneezes]
…w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.
Beth: What?!
What does Morty’s skin smell like?
How soft… [grunts] How soft are his privates?
Beth: Let go of me, davin!
[Glass shatters]
[roars] Take me to Morty.
Jerry: [grunts] You’re not Morty.
Jerry: No.
I’m mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.
That’s… stupid.
Jerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.
Beth: Jerry! Thank god!
Jerry: God?
God’s turning people into insect monsters, Beth.
I’m the one beating them to death.
Thank me.
Beth: Thank you, Jerry.
Thank you.
Rick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it’s all back to normal.
Morty: Just do it already.
Rick: Well, technically, Morty, there’s no rush.
I mean, you know, o-once it’s fixed, it’s done.
It’s fixed.
You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.
I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.
I mean, Morty, w-w-when’s the next time you’re gonna see something like this?
I mean, soak it in, you know?
It’s it’s pretty neat.
It’s pretty interesting.
Morty: That’s it, Rick!
I’m pulling the lever.
[Grunts]
Rick: W-what do we have here, Morty?
Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?
I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?
I-i-i bet you feel like the world’s smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.
Morty: Oh, Rick, something’s not right.
Rick: [sighs] Yeah, you.
You’re not right ever.
Morty: No, no!
Look, you idiot!
[All screaming]
[all speaking native language]
[all groaning]
[all ululating]
Rick: Bet you’re loving this, Morty.
This must be the best day of your life.
You get to be the mayor of I told you town.
[Slurps]
You’re welcome.
[Slurps]
Jerry: Hold on.
Beth: [whimpers]
[engine revs, tires squeal]
[gun cocks]
Jerry: I wish that shotgun was my pen1s.
Beth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway.
Jerry: I don’t get it, and I don’t need to.
[Both moaning]
Summer: Mom! Dad!
Both: Summer!
Beth: [sighs]
Jerry: Where’s Morty?
Summer: I don’t know.
Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this?
Jerry: It’s not fair to assume that, Summer.
Beth: Oh, not fair?
Give me a break.
He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.
A real man stands by his woman.
[Both moaning]
Summer: Tchoo.
Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo.
Rick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn’t i?
We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.
A-at least they’re not in love with you anymore, though.
That’s a huge step in the right direction.
Morty: Oh, my god!
It’s a living nightmare!
How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?
Rick: Me irresponsible?!
You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!
You’re the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a… roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.
I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty?
You’re gonna try to take the high road on this one?
Y-y-y-y-you’re a little creep, Morty.
Y-you’re a you’re you’re you’re just a little creepy… creep person.
Morty: All right, fine.
I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.
I’m willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.
But I’ll tell you something you know what?
You got to accept your part of the blame!
I’m not the one who fouled up the serum!
I’m not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs!
You got to fix this, Rick!
Morty: All right, all right, Morty.
You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that’ll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.
Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.
[Birds chirping]
Morty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.
I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.
Whoo!
That’s some great luck.
Rick: Come on, Morty.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I’m great.
That’s the real reason.
Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?
Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer?
Morty: Sure thing, Rick.
Here’s a screwdriver.
Rick: All right, Morty.
Thank you very much.
We got one screw turn… and two screw turns… and… all right, Morty, here we are.
Morty: Oh, my god, Rick!
Is that us?!
W-w-w-we’re dead!
What is going on, Rick?
I’m freaking out!
Rick: Calm down, Morty!
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!
Morty: No, I can’t deal with this!
Rick: Calm yourself, Morty.
Morty: I can’t deal with this, Rick!
Rick: Calm down, Morty.
Morty: This can’t be real!
Rick: You got to calm down, Morty.
Morty: W-w-w-w-we’re ripped apart!
Rick: Shut up and listen to me!
It’s fine. Everything is fine.
There’s an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal.
I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time.
Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.
We’re not skipping a beat, Morty.
Now, help me with these bodies.
Morty: This is insane.
Rick: Look, Morty, I’ll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.
Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind?
Rick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty?
The answer is don’t think about it.
It’s not like we can do this every week, anyways.
We get three or four more of these, tops.
Now, pick up your dead self and come on.
Haste makes waste.
I-i-i don’t suppose you’ve considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn’t screwed up as much as I did, we’d be these guys right now, so, again, you’re welcome.

Summer: You know, the thing about a shark… he’s got lifeless eyes… black eyes, like a doll’s eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn’t seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water…
Jerry: [sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
Beth: Sometimes. But, I’m ashamed to admit, now that they’re gone, I’m finally happy.
Rick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.
We’ll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.
It’ll be like we never even left cronenberg world.
Morty: Yeah, Cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I’m gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?
I mean, I-I wish we hadn’t genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.
Cronenberg Rick: Don’t you worry about that sort of thing, Cronenberg Morty. Let’s go make ourselves at home, huh?

Int. Smith Residence. The Smith Family and Rick are sitting in the living room watching TV.

Bachelor (on TV): Cynthia…

Jerry: Oh, my God! No, no…!

Summer: I told you!

Beth: Hold on.

Bachelor (on TV): Will you please… NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.

Summer: What?

Jerry: Yes!

Beth: Called it.

Summer: Why would he choose Veronica?

Jerry: Because he loves her?

Rick: Well if it’s any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.

Jerry: Okay, I’ve got an idea, Rick: you show us your concept of "good TV", and we’ll crap all over that.

Rick: [stands, walking to the TV] I thought you’d never ask.

[disconnects and drops cable box, which breaks upon impact to the floor]

Jerry: Hey!

Morty: Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions.

Rick: [working on the cable box] 20% accurate, as usual, [snatching the remote from Morty] Morty. [reconnecting the cable box as the TV buffers] The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.

Jerry: Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?

Rick: How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? [turns on TV]

Corn Man 1 (on TV): We’re not so different. We’re both corn of action.

Corn Man 2 (on TV): Yeah… But one of us is dead corn! [shoots Corn Man 1]

Summer: Boring.

Rick: Summer, [belch] you just spent [belch] three months watching a man choose a fake wife.

Jerry: So, what, It’d be better if the people were corn?

Rick: Jerry, you don’t get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. [changes channel]

Glenn (on TV): This shit is delicious.

Rick: A movie about a guy eating shit. [changes channel, various people are fighting on TV] A violent Antiques Show… [changes channel]

Letterman (on TV): It’s a pleasure to have you.

Jerry (on TV): The pleasure’s all mine.

Rick: Letterman from a time line where Jerry’s famous. [changes channel]

Jerry: Wait!

Beth: What in the hell?

Rick: I agree. Where’s this going?

Jerry: No, the other thing! Go back!

Rick: Really? All right, fine.

Woman (on TV): Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can’t eat shit anymore.

Rick: All right, Jerry, when you’re right, you’re right. Now I’m hooked.

Int. Smith Residence. The Smith Family and Rick are sitting in the living room watching TV.

Announcer (on TV): Coming up next on "Shmloo’s the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare.

Shmlony (on TV): Shmlantha, Schmlona!

Rick: Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla".

Shmlony (on TV): Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan--

Rick: All right, that got that actually got old pretty quick.

Jerry: [sighs] Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?

Rick: [flipping through the channels] Infinity’s a big number, Jerry. I don’t remember the channel.

Beth: Go back, go back!

Rick: Jeez. [changes channel]

Jerry (on TV): You speak da tru-tru.

Summer: Oh my God! Dad’s in "Cloud Atlas"!

Jerry: I’m in "Cloud Atlas"! What’s "Cloud Atlas"?

Jerry (on TV): Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru.

Beth: How is this possible?

Rick: Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry’s a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. [changes channel]

Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): And now, another Quick Mystery.

Cop (on TV): I just want to know who could’ve done something like this. It’s a travesty!

Killer 1 (on TV): I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here’s my fingerprints.

Judge (on TV): Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.

[Killer 1 is thrown in jail]

Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Here’s another Quick Mystery.

Man (on TV): My mother’s dead!

Killer 2 (on TV): And I killed her. Here’s the weapon. And cuff me, thank you very much.

Judge (on TV): Guilty! Sentenced to murder.

[Killer 2 is killed via electric chair]

Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Here’s anothe--

Killer 3 (on TV): I’m the killer! [puts gun in mouth, firing it once offscreen]

Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Wow, that one was really quick, wasn’t it?

Rick: Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?

Beth, Summer, and Jerry [all at once]

Narcissism.

The narcisstic stuff.

I want to obsess about myself.

Rick: [sighs] Here. [stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat] These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. [throws the device into the kitchen] Go fetch!

[Jerry, Summer, and Beth run to the kitchen]

Beth and Summer: [at the same time] Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!

Rick: I’m proud of you, Morty.

Morty: Hey man, I don’t give a crap about myself, Rick. Let’s watch some crazy stuff, yo!

Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson (on TV): I’m Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson’s Electronics. I mean, there’s so many ants in my eyes! And there’s so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can’t-- I’m not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can’t see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren’t too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That’s fair! I’m Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything’s black, I can’t see a thing! [set on fire] And also I can’t feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that’s not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can’t feel. It’s a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don’t allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what’s going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don’t know.

Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen with the Ocular Device.

Beth: Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?

Jerry: You’re right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee-- [grabs the device] Give me those! [turns switch]

Beth: What do you see?

Jerry: Whiteness… Pure whiteness.

Johnny Depp (on Device): You’re my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.

Jerry: Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!

Beth: [sighs, taking the device] Haven’t we spent enough time on you? [turns switch] I’m performing surgery… but not on a horse, on a human!

Jerry: That’s great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon.

Beth: [taking off device] I am a real surgeon.

Jerry: Ahh, uh-- Summer’s turn! [giving Summer the device]

Summer: Finally! I don’t see anything.

Beth: Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there’s a chance you weren’t even born-- That came out wrong, that came out '‘very wrong.

Summer: Fine, I’ll find a world where you bothered to have me. [turns switch a few times] We’re playing Yahtzee.

Beth

Yahtzee’s fun. We love Yahtzee.

Jerry

It’s a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?

Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.

Announcer (on TV)

It’s a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it’s the official car of Mr.

Sneezy 3D. It’s the brand-new Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. [car sneezes] It’s polite, it’s right, and it’s Sneezy Deezy Mc Deluxe.

Mr. Sneezy 3D (on TV)

Oh, I’m Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!

Morty

Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.

Rick

Yeah, it’s got an almost improvisational tone. [changes channel]

Announcer (on TV)

It’s in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came and that’s when things got knocked into 12th gear.

A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from Two--tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business. In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a van from an Asteroid and All Sorts of Things THE MOVIE! Hold on, there’s more! Old women are coming, and they’re also in the movie, and they’re gonna come, and cross attack these two brothers. But let’s get back to the brothers, because they’re-- they have a strong bond. You don’t want to know about it here, but I’ll tell you one thing: The moon it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It’s two brothers and--and th-they’re It’s called Two brothers. Two brothers! [starts laughing] It’s just called Two Brothers.

Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen with the Ocular Device.

Beth

Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize.

Jerry [taking the device]

Come on! Time’s up!

[turns switch] I’m taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie. [gives Summer the device] You get the idea. I work with lions.

Summer [turning switch]

[dryly] Ooh, we’re not playing Yahtzee, [shoves device into Jerry’s hands] we’re playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don’t know, predictable?

Beth

When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.

Jerry

Gimme a break! We’re not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.

Beth

Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.

Jerry

Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!

Beth

[scoffs] What are you talking about?

Jerry

All this time, you’ve been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn’t talked me out of the abortion?"

Summer

Um--

Jerry

Well now you know: you’d be a doctor. [circles finger] Whoop-dee-doo. You’d also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I’d be on DiCaprio’s yacht-- [holds up device] banging Kristen Stewart!

Summer

You thought about getting an abortion?

Beth

Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I’m the version of me that didn’t do it. So you’re welcome.

Jerry

Yeah, you’re welcome.

Summer

Yeah, thank you guys so much. It’s a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.

Rick [walking to the cupboard]

Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? [grabs cookie box. eats cooke and starts walking away] Mm! [stops and looks back at Jerry, Summer and Beth] Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don’t have it as good, huh? That’s too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers". I mean, I don’t want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. [eats another cookie, walking offscreen]

Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.

Rick

I’m in heaven right now. [eating wafer cookies]

Morty

This might be the best day of my life.

Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen.

Beth

So now what do we do?

Jerry

That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.

Summer

Dad!

Jerry

What? They’re having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they’re together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we’re not.

Summer

We’ll I’m leaving!

Beth

You can’t leave, you’re 17!

Summer

Yeah, and I’m not pregnant. I’m gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age.

I’m gonna… move to the southwest and-- I don’t know, do something with turquoise. [walks offscreen]

Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.

[Summer storms off, passing in from of the TV]

Announcer (on TV)'’

Saturday Night Live! Starring a piece of toast! Two guys, with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Garmanarnar! Three s-- uh uh, uh, uh, I’ll get back to that one A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan!

Rick

Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other. Apparently they’ve got some real creative differences. [changes channel]

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

Hey, are you tired of real doors, cluttering up your house, where you open ‘em, and they actually go somewhere? [music starts] And you go in another room?

He walks off the set, still looking at the camera. He gets into he car and starts driving]

Morty

Hey, wait a minute, Rick. Wh-- I thought this was a commercial. Wh-what’s going on? I mean--

Rick

Relax, Morty. Don’t-don’t worry about it. Let’s just just see where this goes.

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

[honks horn]Step on it, we all got places to be! [honks] Son of a bitch!

Morty

See, that must be where he lives. OK…

Rick

Huh. Making himself a sandwich now..

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

[music starts back up] Hey everybody! So this is my house, I just made a sandwich, peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors!

Morty

What?!

Rick

Oh, my God! It’s still the commercial!

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

We have fake doors like you wouldn’t believe! What are you worried about? Come get fake doors. Call us up, and order some fake doors today. Don’t even hesitate, Don’t even worry and don’t even…

Rick

All right, I’m bored. Change it.

Morty

Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on…

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

…give it a second thought. That’s our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here’s another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors! Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms.

Morty

Okay, okay, you can change it.

Fake Doors Salesman (on TV)

Don’t even worry about it!

[channel changes]

Gazorpazorpfield (on TV)

[yawns] I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas.

Morty

Hey Rick, that’s pretty cool! It’s just like Garfield, only instead, it’s Gazorpazorpfield.

Rick

Hey, isn’t Gazorpazorp where-where uh, where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing?

Morty

Yeah hey, that’s pretty, pretty that’s true. That’s right!

Rick

Yeah. Let’s watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!

Gazorpazorpfield (on TV)

Hey Jon, it’s me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy, fuck you, Jon. You fucking dumb, stupid, idiot.

Jon (on TV)

Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh?

Gazorpazorpfield (on TV)

You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white uh, uh guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage.

Jon

Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, that’s-- you know you’re pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.

Gazorpazorpfield (on TV)

I don’t give a fuck! I’m Gazorpazorp-fucking-field, bitch!

[kicks coffee cup over] Now give me my fucking enchiladas!

Morty

Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

Rick

No, Morty, it’s Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he’s still alive.

Morty

Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?

Rick

Yeah, I’m pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it’s the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.

Morty

Yeah, that’s pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?

Rick

I don’t know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?

Int. Smith Residence. Jerry and Beth are in the kitchen.

Beth

Did you really talk me out of the abortion? [drinking from a now empty winebox]

Jerry

Well, we… we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.

Beth

I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to… do something with turquoise.

Jerry

Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.

Beth

So, we didn’t do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves… or…

Jerry

Or?

Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.

Spokesman (on TV)

I’m my name is Mister… Tophat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pig-dul smiggles. I’m keeping ‘em all for me.

Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming!

Morty

Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That’s some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.

Rick

Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal t-to the metal, Morty.

Summer

So, you’re not my brother?

Morty

I’m better than your brother. I’m a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don’t run". Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV.

Rick: [tired] Yeah, sweetie, they-- that’s where they live.

Jerry: Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?

Morty: Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own?

Rick [getting angry] Look, I don’t know! I’m watching the-- same thing you guys are.

Summer: Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again?

Rick: [angry] I don’t know, Summer! I can’t even hear the TV! [stands up, drawing his Portal Gun] All right, that’s it. We’re just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day.

Plot
[Open: Smith kitchen, int. Rick, Jerry, Beth are eating breakfast. Rick is building a robot at the table. Jerry is playing Jerry’s Game]

(Rick starts welding. The bulk of the sparks fly towards Jerry, who turns away to dodge the bulk of them. Morty enters the room)

Morty Smith: Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?

Rick Sanchez: Whatever.

Jerry: Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.

Rick: Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.

Beth: [typing on phone] Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.

(Beth sends Morty a text saying “Your father is insecure about his intelligence” which Morty reads)

Morty: [putting away phone, clears throat] Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?

Jerry: Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.

[Rick finishes the robot he was working on]

Butter robot: What is my purpose?

Rick: Pass the butter.

(Butter robot passes butter)

Rick: Thank you.

Morty: [sighs]

(Summer enters)

Summer: Dad, I need a ride to work.

Jerry: Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science.

Rick: I’m busy.

Summer: Doing what?

Rick: Uh, anything else?

(Summer glares at Rick. Rick glares back)

Butter robot: What is my purpose?

Rick: You pass butter.

Butter robot: Oh my god.

Rick: Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

[into plays]

[Rick and Summer are in Rick’s spaceship. Rick’s driving, Summer’s in the passenger seat]

Rick: Since when did you have a job?

Summer: Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.

Rick: Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character.

Summer: Please don’t.

[Trans. Summer’s workplace, Needful Things. It’s empty except for Mr Needful, who’s arranging his wares. Mr Goldenfold enters]

Goldenfold: Oh… when did this stop being jamba juice?

Needful: I’ve just recently opened for business, Mr, um, Goldenfold.

Goldenfold: You know my name? That’s disarming.

Needful: I also know you long for female company.

Goldenfold: You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can’t be filled with jamba juice.

Needful: This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge: one never pays here. Not with money.

Goldenfold: Nothing to read into there! Thanks!

(Goldenfold takes the aftershave and leaves. Rick and Summer enter)

Summer: Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving.

Rick: (inspecting objects) Huh.

Needful: Tell me Rick, what do you desire?

Rick: Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?

Needful: What? Sorry?

Rick: I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?

Summer: Grandpa Rick!

Rick: Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science.

Needful: Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this. [picks up microscope] This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.

Rick: Hahahahaha.

(The two continue laughing, each getting louder as they try to outdo each other)

Summer: Grandpa, go home and drink!

(Rick snatches the microscope from Mr. Needful and leaves)

[Trans. Int. Smith living room. Morty and Jerry are on the floor surrounded by art supplies]

Jerry: Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age.

Morty: Oh. Ok.

Jerry: You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-

Morty: Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet.

Jerry: [laughing] Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade.

Morty: Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it.

Jerry: Morty, nobody changed the planets.

Morty: I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006.

Jerry: Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree.

Morty: You… disagree?

Jerry: That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball.

Morty: Um, ok, I just have to-

Jerry: Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?

Morty: Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Dayum!

Jerry: Oh. [coughs] Okay good. This is gonna be fun!

[Trans. Int. garage. Rick’s building a contraption, connected to a laptop and pointing towards the microscope he got from Mr. Needful. Morty walks past to get to the bathroom, but Rick interrupts him before he can get there]

Rick: Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?

Morty: Um…

Rick: Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.

(The machine scans the microscope. A bar on the laptop marked “IQ” drops to close to 0)

Rick: Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.

Morty: Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?

Rick: Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.

Morty: Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing.

Rick: Well that’s retarded.

(Jerry lifts up the garage door)

Jerry: What are you guys talking about?

Rick: Apparently nothing.

Jerry: You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you?

Morty: No!

Rick: It’s not.

Jerry: Shut up, Rick.

Rick: Whoa.

Jerry: I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet planet planet.

(Jerry leaves angrily)

Rick: Stay scientific, Jerry.

[Trans. Needful Things, ext. Mr Goldenfold enters the shop, followed by several women. Shot changes to interior. Mr Needful is at the counter, Summer is dusting. Several customers are shopping]

Goldenfold: This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!

Needful: A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price… for everything! Muahahahaha!

Goldenfold: (crying) Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-

(Rick enters, kneels down and injects a serum into Goldenfold’s neck)

Rick: This serum should counteract the negative effects.

Goldenfold: [looking into own pants] Holy cats! Ladies, let’s get out of here.

[Goldenfold and co. leave]

Goldenfold (outside): I haven’t learned a thing!

Rick: [giving back microscope] Here. You can have this back.

Needful: You didn’t use it?

Rick: Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say, [scans] a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.

Needful: Be quiet!

Rick: Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling [scans] beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?

(A customer looking at beauty cream leaves in a hurry)

Needful: I find this all quite preposterous!

Rick: Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo. [scans animal fur scarf being tried on by customer] That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?

(The customer rushes out. All other customers leave too)

Needful: Do I need to call the police?

Rick: Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack.

(Mr. Needful slaps the phone out of Rick’s hand. Rick slaps Mr. Needful’s hat off his head)

Summer: Hey! No! Ugh!

(The two start slapping each other. Summer’s protests punctuate the fight)

Rick: Think you’re so great?

Summer: Stop it!

(Summer gets between the two)

Summer: No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!

(She pushes them away from each other)

Summer: Grandpa Rick, I like working here!

Rick: You work for the devil!

Summer: So what?

Rick & Needful: So what?

Summer: Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye.

(Summer guides Rick out. On the way, Rick purposely knocks over a vase and slams the door. A ghost flies out and into the ceiling with a cackle)

Rick: Whoops.

Summer: I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but…

Needful: It’s fine. Summer, you know your grandfather’s right. This store curses people. That’s my business.

Summer: Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me.

Needful: Please, call me the devil.

Summer: I’d rather not, actually.

Needful: Yes, perhaps not during business hours.

[Trans. Smith living room. Morty’s painting planets, Jerry’s on the phone]

Jerry: I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first! [hangs up] I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.

Morty: Dad, what’s your endgame?

Jerry: Ain’t no game, sucka.

Morty: Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!

Jerry: Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty!

(The house starts shaking. Jerry, Morty and the art supplies start flying)

Jerry & Morty: Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

Jerry: What the hell?

(The two fly through the roof. A tractor beam from an alien spacecraft has abducted them)

[Trans. City in Pluto, ext]

[Trans. Plutonian building. The spaceship lands in front of the door and a ramp appears, leading Jerry and Morty downwards. King Flippynips approaches, being carried by four other plutonians]

Flippynips: I’m King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!

(Flippynips is let down)

Flippynips: We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!

Jerry: I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction.

Flippynips: I’d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.

Jerry: Oh. I…

(Flippynips leads Jerry and Morty to a balcony overlooking millions of Plutonians, all cheering. Flippynips speaks into a microphone)

Flippynips: Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he’s creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!

Jerry: Pluto… is a planet.

Flippynips: Pluto’s a fucking planet, bitch!

Morty: [to himself] Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.

[Trans. Needful things. Mr. Needful is at the counter, serving principal Vagina. Summer is working]

Needful: If it’s athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might-

Vagina: [taking ball] I’ll take it!
Needful: But I haven’t even-
Vagina: Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye.
(Principal Vagina leaves)
Needful: Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather’s outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I’ve had since Salem!
Summer: Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?
Needful: Is that the vegan place?
Summer: Yeah, I love their soup.
Needful: I’m kind of souped out.
(A customer enters the store)
Needful: Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?
(She takes an armful of goods and makes to leave)
Needful: Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!
Tate: Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s free, right?
Summer: Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money. [laughing]
Needful: [laughing] That was perfect.
Tate: You pay with the curses, right?
Needful: Um, I… well-
(She opens the door to leave)
Needful: But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?
Tate: Well, I’m going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?
(She points at the TV and leaves. Rick’s on. Mr. Needful turns up the volume)
Needful: What?
Rick (TV): Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that grants you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, eight million dollars? See ya at the olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes.
Baby (TV): Everything’s deductible.
Rick (TV): Don’t pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We’re located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down.
Needful: First… and…
Rick (TV): Wubba… lubba… dub dub!
(Mr Needful looks outside and pulls up the blind. Curse Purge Plus is opposite Needful Things. Rick’s flipping them the bird)
Rick (Outside): Wubba lubba dub dub!
Rick (TV): That’s right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!
Needful: Diabolical son of a mother-
(The door opens and customers rush in, looting the place)
[Trans. Pluto. Jerry’s being recorded for a talk show. Morty’s watching]
Hostess: We’re back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?
Jerry: Pluto is a planet.
Host: [laughing] How about that?
Hostess: Wow. I love it!
(Scroopy Noopers enters from behind Morty)
Scroopy Noopers: Morty Smith. I’m Scroopy Noopers. I’m a scientist. Can I show you something?
Morty: Uh… I’d better not.
Scroopy Noopers: [pulling out a gun] Right now.
[Trans. Plutonian mines. Scroopy Noopers takes Morty for a tour. Machines pump glowing blue rocks to the surface]
Scroopy Noopers: The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.
(The planet shakes)
Scroopy Noopers: There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won’t wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof. [At the last word, he blows a handful of blue dust into the air]
Morty: Um… A party?
Scroopy Noopers: Is everyone in your family an idiot?
Morty: For sure me and my dad are.
Scroopy Noopers: [sigh] Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.
Morty: Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure.
[Trans. Needful things. The store is empty except for Summer, who’s cleaning up, and Mr. Needful, who’s in the back out of view. The shelves are all empty. Summer spots a monkey paw on the floor and picks it up]
Summer: Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of!
(She opens the door to the back room and sees that Mr Needful has hung himself)
Summer: Ah! Oh my god!
(She tries to pull him down. When that fails she pushes at a desk in the corner to try and move it under him, also unsuccessfully)
Summer: Oh my god. (using monkey paw) I wish this desk was lighter!
(One of the paw’s three fingers goes down. She easily pushes the desk under Mr Needful and struggles to untie the noose)
Summer: (using monkey paw) I wish this knot was looser!
(The second finger goes down. The noose comes undone easily and she rushes over and tries to perform CPR, though she doesn’t know how)
Summer: Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing? (using monkey paw) I wish I knew CPR!
(The third finger goes down. Summer performs CPR)
Summer: One, two, three! One, two, three!
(Mr Needful splutters and regains consciousness)
Needful: [coughing] Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw.
Summer: Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?
Needful: I’m the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?
Summer: You haven’t failed.
Needful: People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I’m smart and funny.
Summer: No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?
Needful: Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name it.
Summer: I wanna help you.
Needful: Clever twist.
Summer: I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated.
[Trans. Curse Purge Plus, int. Customers are bringing up their items to be scanned and treated]
Rick: Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens.
(Summer enters with a box of items)
Rick: Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?
Summer: Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.
Rick: Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’
Summer: That was important to you, wasn’t it?
Rick: Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.
Summer: He tried to kill himself.
Rick: Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
Summer: But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up.
Rick: Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care.
Summer: Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care.
Rick: So?
Summer: So… have fun not caring.
Rick: I always do.
Summer: Good.
Rick: Yeah, it is good. It’s the best.
Summer: I’m sure it is. Bye.
Rick: Later!
(Summer leaves)
Customer: I’m here to pick up my undead cat and child.
Rick: Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.
Employee: These are the forms for the employee health plan.
Rick: Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh.
(He pours gasoline on the floor and sets it on fire)
Rick: I just got bored. Everybody out.
[Trans. Pluto. Morty and Jerry are in suits in the passenger seats of an alien car. Jerry is fussing over his appearance in a small mirror)
Jerry: Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project.
Morty: Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!
Jerry: Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?
Morty: You told me science wasn’t easy!
Jerry: I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son.
Morty: Dad, their whole planet is dying!
Jerry: Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.
(The car parks and Jerry gets out, to fanfare)
Jerry: What’s up, Pluto?
[Trans. Plutonian ball. Music is playing. Jerry is being treated like a celebrity. He’s approached by a plutonian woman and man]
Plutonian woman: Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on.
Jerry: My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto.
(The plutonian man does a spit take)
Plutonian man: My god! The man’s a genius!
Morty: Um, excuse me? [taps champagne glass with spoon]
Jerry: Morty, what?
Morty: Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?
Jerry: ...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?
Plutonians: [laughing]
Jerry: I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?
Morty: Good one, dad.
(Morty leaves)
[Trans. Smith house, int. Rick’s home alone, looking into various rooms]
Rick: [looks into Morty’s room] Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh. [goes into kitchen] Hey Beth? Hello? [Goes into living room] Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? [sighs]
(Rick eats dinner at the table alone. The butter robot deposits an entire block of butter into Rick’s dinner without being asked. Rick throws the butter away)
Rick: Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…
Butter robot: I am not programmed for friendship.
Rick: Suit yourself.
[Morty lands and comes back in. Rick pretends not to be too happy about it]
Rick: Hey! [clears throat] Hey. What’s going on?
Morty: Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?
Rick: Whatever.
[Trans. Pluto. Jerry is preparing for another rally with King Flippynips]
Flippynips: Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!
Jerry: I’m flattered, and humbled.
Flippynips: Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that.
Policeman: Your highness! We’ve captured Scroopy Noopers!
(Scroopy Noopers is dragged in with his hands behind his back by two policemen)
Scroopy Noopers: You animals! Animals!
Flippynips: Ooh, look whose little journey’s come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!
Scroopy Noopers: You can’t kill the truth, father!
Jerry: What?
Flippynips: I can see you’re confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-
Jerry: Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?
Flippynips: The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.
Jerry: It’s a what?
Flippynips: Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That’s what I meant. Knock ‘em dead out there, you. [sips champagne]
[Trans. Award ceremony. Jerry is giving his acceptance speech]
Jerry: Pluto is…
(He looks down at the card, which just says “Pluto = planet.” In the crowd is a young Plutonian who strongly resembles Morty. Jerry tears up)
Jerry: [sigh] Not a planet.
Crowd: Boo! [throws things]
Jerry: Ow! It’s not a planet! Hey! It’s not a planet! I’m an idiot, and I love my son!
(Jerry is forcefully dragged away)
[Trans. N33dful.com launch meeting. Summer and Mr Needful are standing in front of a screen saying “n3”]
Needful: It’s been a long six hours, but we’ve overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 e-nomenon, n33dful.com! Spelled with 3s instead of Es.
Crowd: Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!
Needful: Okay, that’s it! We just got bought by Google!
Crowd: Yeah!
(Summer hugs Mr. Needful)
Summer: Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make?
Needful: Haha. ‘We.’ [pushes Summer away] This is my business! Security!
(Security comes and takes Summer away)
Summer: Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me?
Needful: I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg’s balls dropped. I’m the devil, beeyotch! What what!
(He jumps on the table and plays the fiddle)
[Trans. Smith house, ext. Jerry is dropped unceremoniously on the ground. His suit is torn, he has a black eye and an injured leg]
Jerry: Hey!
(He flips off the spaceship and limps inside to Morty’s room. Morty’s pants are off, but his pubic area is hidden by a laptop)
Jerry: Hey Morty.
Morty: Oh! Hey dad! [closes laptop] Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?
Jerry: Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.
Morty: Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that.
Jerry: Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?
Morty: Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A. [Holds up butter robot]
Butter robot: Butter.
Jerry: But-
Morty: You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!
Jerry: Oh. I uh- I think I underst-
Morty: You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.
Jerry: I get it! Say no more.
Morty: I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-
Jerry: I got it! Noted! Goodnight!
[Trans. Living room. The lights are off. Rick’s watching Ball Fondlers. Summer comes in with mascara smears down her face, as if she’s been crying. She turns on the light]
Rick: How’s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?
Summer: He dumped me.
Rick: Oof, sorry.
(Summer makes her way to the couch and sits down, and wipes the mascara off her face. Rick makes room)
Summer: Did we learn a lesson here I’m not seeing?
Rick: Hm, not sure.
Summer: Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn’t realise how much you valued my approval?
Rick: No, that’s dumb.
Summer: Nah, not satisfying.
Rick: I’ll tell you what though, if it’s satisfaction you’re after, I think I might have an idea. [whispers]
Summer: [listening] Uh huh… uh huh… uh huh totally let’s do it!
[X Gon’ Give It To Ya by DMX starts playing. Summer and Rick have a montage of them doing normal family bonding activities, such as weightlifting and doing steroids together. As the song progresses they get more buff. The music stops]
[Trans. Mr Needful giving a speech]
Needful: And that’s how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront! Thank you Seattle!
(The audience applauds. Summer and Rick break down the back of the stage and start beating up Mr. Needful. The audience stops applauding and someone screams)
Needful: Rick? Summer?
Rick: Stupid mother-
Summer: Stupid bitch!
Rick: Stupid motherfucker!
Summer: Get some!
Rick: How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?
(Mr. Needful is thrown onto the ground. He has a black eye, a few bruises and seems to be injured. Rick and Summer look down at him from above)
Needful: Ugh… Why?
Summer: (lifting Mr. Needful by the neck of his shirt) Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.
(She drops him and lifts her fist as if to punch again. Mr. Needful cowers. Summer spits on him)
[Trans. Outside a coffee shop. Rick and Summer are both drinking coffee]
Rick: We did it!
Summer: Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha!
Rick: Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!
Summer: Yeah bro!
Rick: Hahaha!

Summer: Yeah.

[Post credits scene: X Gon’ Give It To Ya starts playing. Rick and Summer beat up a nazi wearing suspenders, a schoolyard bully, a man holding a “God hates fags!” sign and a man walking his dog who yanks its collar hard when it tries to stop]

Plot
[The Smith family is seen sitting around the table eating breakfast. The viewer at this point doesn’t know that this scene is set in a dimension that is not Dimension C-137 with a different Smith family, but this will be apparent at the end of the scene.]

Beth: So dad, guess what tomorrow is…

Rick: Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday.

Beth: No… well, it might be…

Rick: It is.

Beth: Fine, but also, tomorrow is your 1 year anniversary back in our lives. I’m gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes.

Rick: Oh, there’s no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.

(A portal appears on their wall and Evil Rick and Evil Morty emerge from it carrying a gun and a tranquilizer respectively. Evil Rick shoots Rick in the head and kills him. Evil Morty shoots Morty in the shoulder with his tranquilizer and he passes out. Evil Morty then drags Morty across the breakfast table and he and Evil Rick drag Morty through the portal, and the portal disappears. The family screams in horror the entire time.)

[Opening sequence plays]

(The Smith family is seen sitting around the table eating breakfast. This scene takes place in Dimension C-137)

Beth: Happy anniversary, dad!

Rick: Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. [takes bite] Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.

Jerry: Should be making us a whole restaurant.

Beth: Nonsense, we couldn’t be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you.

(Three armed Ricks come into the room through a portal)

Alternative Rick 1: Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks.

Jerry: Hey! What the heck?

Alternative Rick 1: Neutralize the Jerry.

Jerry: Wait, no!

(Rick 2 shoots at Jerry, freezing him)

Summer: Dad!

Beth: Dad!

Morty: Rick!

Rick (C-137): Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let’s get it over with.

Alternative Rick 1: Bring his Mo-[belches]-orty.

Morty: Oh, man.

Rick (C-137): Leave my [belches] Morty out of this!

Alternative Rick 1: You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join [belches] the council.

Beth: Wait, wh-wh-wh-what about Jerry?

Rick (C-137): Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot?

(Rick 1 unfreezes Jerry. Rick 2 and Rick 3 take Rick through the portal and all exit)

Jerry: -give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection, just don’t hurt me! [pauses] Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons.

Beth: Our son’s been abducted!

Jerry: You hate me for buying those coins!

[Trans. Ext Citadel of Ricks]

[Trans. Int Citadel of Ricks. The three armed Ricks and C-137 Rick and Morty enter through a portal]

Morty (C-137): Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place?

Rick (C-137): The citadel of Ricks. It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.

Morty (C-137): Council of Ricks?

Rick (C-137): As you know, Morty, I’ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers.

Morty (C-137): Hey, what do you know? It’s a cowboy version of me!

Rick (C-137): Geez, you’re easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me.

Rick Salesman 1: Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!

Rick Salesman 2: Hey, check this out!

(Rick Salesman 2 holds up a Morty doll and presses a button in the middle)

Morty Doll: Show me the Morty!

Rick (C-137): Dumb.

Rick Salseman 3: ‘Scuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-

Rick (C-137): Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place.

[Trans. Hallway leading to the Council]

Rick (C-137): I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick.

Alternative Rick 1: Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!

Rick (C-137): Hey, save your Rick rules for the [belches] sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!

Alternative Rick 1: *ck me, pal.

Rick (C-137): *ck you? No no no no no, *ck me!

(They reach the end of the hallway and the door opens automatically, revealing the council of Ricks)

Riq IV: Bring up the holograms!

(A screen depicting several dead Ricks appears)

Riq IV: 27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?

Rick (C-137): You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?

Riq IV: You [belches] have a history of non-cooperation with the council.

Rick (C-137): Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs?

Riq IV: Because he’s dead too!

Rick crowd: No!

Riq IV: Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you’re the malcontent. The rogue.

Rick (C-137): I’m the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

Rick crowd: (Can you believe this guy? This guy needs to get out of here, etc. Ad lib)

Rick (C-137): Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!

Riq IV: Evidence? Good idea. Scan his portal gun!

(Rick 1 reaches into C-137’s lab coat and retrieves his portal gun)

Rick (C-137): Oh, come on. Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places.

Riq IV: Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!

(A diagram appears on the screen, displaying C-137’s portal gun history. Entries for certain dimensions flash green before it finally settles on a select few which flash red)

Rick (C-137): What? That’s Rick-diculous. I’m obviously being set up!

Riq IV: Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls.

Rick (C-137): I’ve heard enough.

(C-137 elbows Rick 1 and tackles him into Rick 2, taking his gun and shooting through his own and then Morty’s handcuffs. The two run away)

Rick (C-137): Run, Morty!

(A Morty from the crowd starts to run too)

Crowd rick: Uh uh, not you!

[Trans. back to corridor. Rick and Morty (C-137) are running, and are being chased by Ricks]

Morty (C-137): Aaaaah!

(Rick shoots into the side walls with his portal gun. As the chasing Ricks pass, several of them get set on fire, attacked by insects, dragged into the portals by tentacles or hit by falling pumpkins)

Armed Rick 1: Nooo!
Armed Rick 2: Arrrrgh! Ahhhh!
Armed Rick 3: Aaaah!
Armed Ricks 4 and 5: Oof!

(The two reach the end of the corridor, which cuts off to a moveable ramp which is currently down and is blocked by a railing. They leap over. As they fall, Rick C-137 shoots a portal beneath them which they then fall through)

[Trans. Buttworld. Rick and Morty C-137 fall through a portal onto a large butt mountain. They bounce off and continue running]

Morty (C-137): Oh! Oooh!

(Rick C-137 shoots a portal in between two buttcheeks, which they run through, with the other Ricks in hot pursuit)

[Trans. Pizza dimension. A pizza sits on a couch dialing on a phone, while another is lying down on another couch)
Pizza 1: Yeah, I’d like to order one large person with extra people please.
Pizza 2: White people. No no no no no, black people. And hispanic on half.

(C-137 Rick and Morty run out of a portal and shoot another portal onto the opposite wall, then run through. The Ricks and Mortys chasing them follow)

[Trans. Greasy grandma world. The dimension is full of greasy grandmas. A banner says “Welcome to greasy grandma world. Population: A whole lot, sonny!”]

(C-137 Rick and Morty run through, avoiding the grandmas as much as possible. They shoot another portal in the wall and run through. The Ricks and Mortys chasing them follow)

[Trans. Phone dimension. A phone sits on a pizza dialing on a person, while another is lying down on another pizza]
Phone 1: Yes, I’d like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please.
Phone 2: High chair. No no no no no, recliner! And wheelchair on half.

(C-137 Rick and Morty run out of a portal and shoot another portal onto the opposite wall, then run through. The Ricks and Mortys chasing them follow)

[Trans. Doopidoo dimension. Several doopidoo creatures stand around repeating the phrase “Doopidoo” over and over]

(Rick C-137 shoots several portals into the wall, and enters the last one. The Ricks and Mortys chasing them enter the dimension but don’t know which portal to go into)

Armed Rick 6: They could have gone into any one of these.
Armed Ricks: (Ugh, son of a-, aw geez, aw man, we lost him, etc. Ad lib)

[Trans. Chair dimension. A sofa sits on a person dialing on a pizza, while another is lying down on another person]
Sofa 1: Yeah, I’d like to order one large phone with extra phones please.
Sofa 2: Cellphone. No no no no no, rotary! And payphone on half.

(C-137 Rick and Morty run out of a portal)

Rick: That’ll keep ‘em [belches] busy for a while.

Morty: Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves?

Rick: 'Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names.

(The two pass a homeless sofa, who’s initially drinking but stares at them as they pass and dumps out his bottle)

Rick: By finding the real Rick killer.

Morty: I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers.

Rick: Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.

[Trans. Smith living room. Jerry’s reading a newspaper, Summer’s on her phone, and a bunch of Ricks and Mortys are searching the place]

Rick 1: Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep ‘em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer.

Beth: Who wants lemonade?

Rick 1: Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!

Rick 2: Beth, [belches] you’re a treasure.

Rick 3: I have a Beth just like you in my [belches] reality, except you know what? She’s not as brilliant or[belches] attractive!

Beth: Aww, thank [belches] you!

All Ricks: Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!

(Phone rings. Rick 4 makes a signal to say they’re tracing the signal. Jerry picks it up)

Jerry: Uh, hello?

Rick (phone): Hey Jerry, it’s Rick.

Jerry: Rick! Heyy. Haha, what’s- what’s up?

Rick (phone): So listen, the heat’s on and [belches] there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole.

Jerry: What?

Rick (phone): Is that cool with you, dog?

Jerry: Rick, no! Mortyyyy!

Rick 4: I got it! The call’s coming from… ♫inside the house!♫

All Ricks: [laughing] (Look at his face! I can’t believe our daughter married you, too easy, etc. Ad lib)

[Trans. Chair dimension. Rick and Morty are in a restaurant run by chairs]

Rick: The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.

Chair waiter: Phones á la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. Anything else?

Rick: Yeah, more phonesticks please.

Phone waiter: Right away, sir.

Morty: You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.

Rick: Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage.

Morty: Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?

Rick: Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh, [clears throat] Morty waves.

Morty: Um… because… our personalities are so different?

Rick: Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!

(The two stand up. As they’re about to leave, two Ricks and a Morty enter the restaurant and address the waiter)

Rick (C-137): Uh-oh!

Rick 1: ‘Scuse me, we’ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I’m going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they’re the evil one, you’ll know who’s lying.

Rick 2: Hey, check it out!

(Two person-chairs that look like Rick and Morty from behind are beside a table. When the two Ricks rush over to turn them around, it’s revealed that they’re not)

Rick 1: Dammit!

(They look out the window, to see C-137 flipping them off from in a police hovercraft. They rush outside, and the waiter follows)

Chair waiter: Hey, you didn’t pay your bill!

Rick 1: The red X! Red X!

[Trans. Green planet. Rick and Morty are flying in the police hovercraft, searching]

Rick: Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?

Morty: Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over.

Rick: Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.

Morty: Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?

Rick: Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.

(In the distance a dome comes into view. Faint yelling can be heard)

Morty: Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building!

Rick: Not people, Morty. Mortys.

(As they get closer, it’s revealed that the dome is covered top to bottom in naked Mortys, who are strapped to the surface and are being tortured with contraptions that stab their sides constantly. Constant Morty yelling can be heard)

Morty (C-137): Oh my god… wh-why would somebody do this? It’s horrible!

Rick: Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, mother*cker. I fiddled with a [belches] concept like this once.

(They land. Morty stares at Rick)

Rick: On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable. [pauses as Morty glares at him] Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship.

[Trans. Smith living room. Ricks are playing cards while Mortys watch. Jerry’s on his laptop]

Beth: Coffee time!

All Ricks: (Yeah! That’s what I like to hear! etc. Ad lib)

(The Ricks run into the kitchen, and the Mortys take the place of the Ricks on the cards table. Doofus Rick enters the house)

Jerry: Ugh.

Doofus Rick: Hi Jerry!

Jerry: Leave me alone, I’m working!

Doofus Rick: Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?

Jerry: Ugh. I’m- I’m in between advertising jobs.

Doofus Rick: Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?

Jerry: W-well, it’s a little more complicated than that…

Doofus Rick: Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together!

Jerry: [Looks around for hiding Ricks] Dude, are you… wh- you’re being a dick, right?

Doofus Rick: Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn’t want to offend you in any way!

Jerry: You’re really a Rick?

Doofus Rick: Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty’s a Morty!

(Doofus Rick’s morty waves to Doofus Rick from the poker table)

Jerry: Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ‘Mask.’ You know, the one with Cher in it?

Doofus Rick: That’s right, Jerry! He-he’s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He’s Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because… I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I’d love ‘em if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.

(Ricks return with coffee)

Rick 1: Hey, get a load of this! Jerry’s hanging out with doofus Rick.

Rick 2: Haha, this is perfect.

Doofus Rick: I’m not doofus Rick! I’m Rick J-19-Zeta-7!

Rick 1: Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?

Doofus Rick: Hey! I don’t eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!

Rick 1 and 2: [laughing]

Doofus Rick: I guess it’s only fair to tell you now, Jerry… I’m the worst Rick of them all.

Jerry: According to who? Other versions of you? If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself.

Doofus Rick: Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that’s why you work in advertising!

Jerry: The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.

[Trans. Int dome. Rick and Morty are exploring corridors]

Morty: You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object!

Rick: Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!

Morty: You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield!

Rick: Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice.

(Morty tears up. A bunch of lobster-like aliens come out of the nearby corridors and surround them)

Rick: Great, nice work, Morty.

(Rick starts attacking and kicking the aliens. He kills the first wave, but more surround them quickly)

Rick: Urrgh.

(Evil Rick and Evil Morty emerge. Evil Rick is slow clapping)

Evil Rick: Ooh, look at you, C-137! You’re- aren’t you a tough customer?

Rick: The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.

Evil Rick: Not in this dimension it isn’t. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before.

Rick: Well lah-dee-dah. [slow claps]

Evil Rick: Hey, that’s mine!

[Trans. Rick and Morty have been apprehended and are being carried down the corridor by lobster aliens]

Rick: I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.

Morty: I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster.

Rick: Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty.

Morty: W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid.

Evil Rick: Take his Morty away.

Evil Morty: Come with me.

Morty: Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?

(The two leave to the left. The view changes to another, smaller corridor, which the two walk down)

Morty: Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there?

Evil Morty: It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.

(He opens a door)

Evil Morty: In here.

(As Morty walks in, he sees it’s filled with a crowd of scared, shivering Mortys. As he tries to leave, Evil Morty closes the door behind him, locking him in)

[Trans. Evil Rick’s lab. Rick is tied to an examination table. An array of computers and other devices are visible. Many of the Mortys from the outside of the dome are visible]

Evil Rick: Ahh, isn’t it beautiful?

Rick: Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!

Lobster alien: Hehehehehehehehehe.

Rick: That guy got it.

Evil Rick: Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You’re missing my symphony.

(Evil Rick presses a button, allowing the sounds of the Mortys in pain to come through. He conducts it for a bit)

Rick: Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!

Lobster alien: Hehehehehehehehehe.

Rick: This guy is on it!

Evil Rick: He’s not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That’s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds.

Lobster alien: Hehehehehehehehehe.

Rick: Awww.

Evil Rick: See, Rick, you’re not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We’re not so [belch] different, you and I.

(Evil Rick activates a display showing all the Ricks from different timelines)

Rick: Yeah, duh!

Evil Rick: See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed ‘em out from most evil to least evil. Here’s where I am. And look at right here’s where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird.

Rick: I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going.

Evil Rick: Please. I think I’m doing pretty good on my own. I’m simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you.

[Trans. Rick’s garage. Doofus Rick is mixing chemicals and Jerry is watching]

Doofus Rick: Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies!

(Jerry takes a brownie, eats it and smiles)

Jerry: It’s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order!

Doofus Rick: Well, come on, I can’t take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C’mere Jerry!

(Both hug and laugh)

Jerry: Hey, uh. C’mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something.

(They exit the garage and Jerry pulls out a box, then opens it to reveal coins with R2D2s on them)

Jerry: Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but… you’re a genius scientist, what do you think? There’s little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!

Doofus Rick: You know Jerry, I’m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is… you bought ‘em ‘cause you like ‘em. They have value to you. That’s what matters.

Jerry: (tearing up) How long are you staying?

Doofus Rick: Until we find your Rick.

Jerry: (hugging doofus Rick) I found mine. I found mine.

[Trans. Morty prison. C-137 Morty is bashing at the door. He is approached by a group of Mortys wearing robes and facepaint]

Morty (C-137): Help!

Religious Morty: There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world.

(Religious Morty offers C-137 a pamphlet titled “The Good Morty”)

Morty (C-137): So what? Y-y-y-y-you’re just going to give up?

Religious Morty: We’re giving in to the power of the One True Morty. One day he will return!

All religious Mortys: Praise the One True Morty!

(Morty opens “The Good Morty” to the first page, then scoffs and throws it away)

Morty (C-137): Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you’re scared, because I’m scared, but that’s no reason to accept our fate. We’re Mortys! We’re not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own!

Morty 1: This sounds like something the One True Morty might say. I’m sick of being a human shield! I-I-I-I wanna be a gardener!

Morty 2: I wanna write really crazy, intense action novels!

Hammer Morty: I’m more than just a hammer!

Religious Morty: He is the one true Morty! The one true Morty!

All Mortys: Hooray!

(The door opens, and a lobster alien walks in)

Lobster alien: Hey, keep it down!

All Mortys: Raaaaugh!

(The Mortys rush the door, breaking free and charging down the corridor)

[Trans. Evil Rick’s lab. Evil Rick is going through Rick’s memories on a screen]

Evil Rick: You’ve lived quite a life, Rick. It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through.

(The memories change theme to feature Morty in each one. Rick tears up)

Evil Rick: You’re crying? Over a Morty?

Rick: No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.

Evil Rick: Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe, it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys.

(The Mortys break through the door and rush at Evil Rick, killing the lobster aliens, surrounding him and tearing into him)

Evil Rick: Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!

(Evil Rick dies. Morty C-137 appears and approaches Rick)

Rick: Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!

Morty (C-137): You’re lucky I’m not a Rick.

(Morty C-137 unbuckles Rick from the examination table)

Rick: Point taken, but this is [belches] no time for arcs.

(He presses a button, disengaging the Morty shield. Mortys are released and pour down off the dome. Rick grabs a phone and rings home)

Rick 1: Yeah, hello?

Rick (C-137): Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?

Rick 1: Huh? Wh-who is this?

Rick (C-137): I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!

[Trans. Jerry and doofus Rick are playing with legos. Rick 1 opens the door]

Rick 1: Yo ding-dong! We’re done here. Time to go.

Doofus Rick: Well Jerry, I [belches] guess this means goodbye.

Jerry: W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe… you know… get rid of him? I’m not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I’m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-

Doofus Rick: Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn’t work. It’s time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya.

(Doofus Rick hugs Jerry and leaves. Jerry makes as if to follow him, then stops and punches a wall. The lego castle they built falls apart)

[Trans. Evil Rick’s lab. The Mortys are still fighting. Ricks from the citadel move in and stop each Morty, pulling them off Evil Rick’s corpse and bringing them back to the citadel]

Morty (C-137): Wh-wh-what’s gonna happen to all these Mortys?

Council Rick 1: They’ll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls… poor little Rickless bastards.

[Trans. Citadel of Ricks. The council has gathered around C-137 Rick and Morty]

Council Rick 1: Earth Rick C-137, the council apologises for its false accusation. And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty, in the event that [belches] your current [belches] Morty should-

Rick: Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it.

(Before they leave, Rick takes the voucher anyway)

[Trans. Citadel outside. Rick and Morty are walking away from the council]

Morty: Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass.

Rick: Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.

Morty: Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?

Rick: Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would [belch] go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty.

Morty: It would go without saying, huh?

Rick: Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?

Morty: Nah… (to himself) The Mortyest Morty…

Rick: Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.

Morty: Oh yeah, how’s that?

Rick: I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.

[Trans. Evil Rick’s lab. Evil Rick is lying in a pool of blood being inspected by Ricks. For the Damaged Coda by Blonde Redhead starts playing in the background]

Rick 1: What a mess…

Rick 2: Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.

Rick 1: What is that?

(Rick 1 turns Evil Rick’s head over to reveal wires)

Rick 2: Hand me the laser defibrillator.

Doofus Rick: Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?

Rick 2: No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you’ll make friends with some turds!

Rick 1: You make us ashamed to be ourselves!

(Rick 2 removes the top of Evil Rick’s head to reveal electronics woven into his brain. They pull out a chip)

Rick 1: My god! I’ve seen this technology before! This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver!

Rick 2: Yeah, but where’s the transmitter?

[Trans. Citadel of Ricks. Mortys are being loaded into spaceships to be delivered to their respective dimensions]

(Evil Morty follows them, and removes his eyepatch, revealing the transmitter. He crushes it underfoot and hides the wires, then follows the rest of the Mortys)

Post-Credit Scene

[Jerry is sitting in Rick’s bedroom, trying not to cry. Rick enters]

Rick: Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?

Jerry: Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.

Rick: Alright. Okay, get out.

(Jerry leaves and goes down to the dining room. He looks outside the window and sees doofus Rick standing in the rain and smiles. Rick appears beside Jerry)

Rick: What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like [belches] ten Ricks to call right now!

[incomplete & unfixed]

This transcript isn't finished! This article is a stub. You can help Transcripts Wiki by expanding it.

(Screen plays the outside of the Smith family's house. Jerry is seen packing stuff into the back of a car that is parked in front of the garage, while Beth is standing by the passenger seat side of the car. Rick, Summer, and Morty are standing by the garage door.)

Summer: Bye, mom! Bye, dad!

Morty: Drive carefully!

Rick: Have fun, you two.

Beth: Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... (Sarcastic and moody) Titanic-themed getaway.

Jerry: (Finishes packing the car, and closes the door of the car.) Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. (Opens the passenger seat door.)

Beth: Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here.

Rick: I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I (belching) have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage.

Beth: (Angry) Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. (Opens the car door off screen.)

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.

Beth and Jerry in unison: That's right.

Jerry: Wait... What?

Rick: Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song "blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop". You guys know that song? (Elbows Morty.) From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?

(Everyone is silent)

Rick: No-nobody? (Angry) A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip.

Jerry: (Serious) Not one thing out of place.

(Beth and Jerry enter the car and drive out of the garage driveway. Jerry then stops the car, and opens the car door.)

Jerry: Not a single thing.

(Jerry closes the door, and they drive away.)

(A few seconds after the car leaves, the garage door disintegrates, as the synthetic laser eels screech and float out of the damaged garage door. Rick, Morty, and Summer watch the eel's float away, and the garage door collapses onto the three. The giant hole in the door keeps them from being squashed.)

Summer: (Happy) Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party.

(Intro plays)

(Screen cuts back to the outside of the Smith family's house. Everyone is in the house, and the garage door was put back into it's original place. There is still a massive burned hole in the door.)

Summer: (Off screen) I found Jello.

(Screen cuts to a shelf with snacks, as Summer grabs a box of crackers. She is taking to someone on her phone.)

Summer: Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. (Grabs another box) Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. (Stops the call)

(Morty enters the kitchen, angry.)

Morty: Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?

(Screen changes to a view of the whole kitchen. Rick walks up to the fridge.)

Summer: Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty.

(Rick is seen searching through the fridge.)

Morty: Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!

Rick: (Pulls out a tray with canapes on it, and places it on the bench off screen.) Uh, Summer, you can't have a party.

Summer: Ugh.

Rick: (Back on screen.) Because (burp) I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! (burp)

Morty: Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!

Summer: What do you mean you're having a party? (Sarcastic) Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?

Rick: "Glip glop?" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that.

Summer: Is that like their n-word?

Rick: It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. (Drinks from a soda can.)

Morty: Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --

Summer: (Interrupts Morty) screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.

Rick: That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17.

Summer: Why do you party?

Rick: To get (burp) wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!

Summer: Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.

Rick: Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. (Places a piece of food into his canapes to finish preparing them.)

(Screen cuts to the Titanic getaway. The boat is seen floating on the water, and people are waiting on the sidewalk.)

(Screen cuts again to the left side of the boat, as people are seen getting a tour of the boat. Beth and Jerry are also seen on the group of poeple. workers are seen painting a giant board of a sunset just next to the boat.)

Tour Guide: After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.

Jerry: A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?

Tour Guide: I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable.

(The group of people applaud.)

Jerry: (Notices the front of the Titanic, full of people.) Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow!

Beth: (Bored and unimpressed) Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read.

(Both walk down some stairs to the front of the boat towards the line of people.)

Beth: Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?

Jerry: Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. (Grabs Beth's hat and places it on her head.) This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone.

Beth: (Looks to her right, and smiles.) Well, what about her?

(A maid is seen mopping up the deck near the two.)

Beth: Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?

Lucy: (Shy) I, uh -- I could get into trouble.

Beth: (Takes off her hat and places it onto Lucy's.) We won't tell.

(Beth lets Lucy go in the line next to Jerry, and walks away, reading a book.)

Jerry: So... You're a Titanic fanatic?

Lucy: Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate.

Jerry: Happy to help... rose.

(They both smile as Lucy grabs Jerry's arm, and they both walk down the line. Lucy giggles.)

(Screen cuts to the Smith family's living room. There are a few people chilling out and eating snacks.)

Tammy: (To a girl) I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it...

(The doorbell rings, and Summer walks over to the door and opens it.)

Summer: Brad! Hey!

Brad: Yo.

(Brad walks into the house with a few other guys.)

Tammy: (To the girl) Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk.

(The girl messes up Tammy's hair. Tammy poses as if she's drunk as Brad and the other guys walk past them.)

Brad: Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.

(Summer watches as the guys walk away. As she goes to close the door, a man who is half bird and half human stops the door. Summer opens the door again.)

Birdperson: The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?

Summer: Ugh! Grandpa!

(Rick walks up to Birdperson, happy to see him. They fistbump. Summer walks away, grumpy.)

Rick: Birdperson!

Birdperson: I am pleased there is no emergency.

Rick: Oh, there's an emergency, all right. (He puts his arm around Birdperson) A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?

Birdperson: It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.

Rick: Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. (Leads Birdperson into the house) Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson.

(Morty walks up to Rick.)

Morty: Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?

Rick: Uh... people? Mm, six.

(A big green spaceship/UFO lands in front of the house. A bunch of happy little green lumpy aliens come running out of the ship/UFO into the house.)

Rick: Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

Morty: Oh, man!

(Screen cuts to the outside of the house. It's nighttime, and people and aliens are seen walking around outside. Two Rick's from the Citadel of Ricks arrive through a portal.)

Morty: (Walking around picking up trash from the ground and putting it in a garbage bag. The house is very crowded) (Huff) (Huff) Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?

(An alien is seen falling off the ceiling.)

(Morty hears a noise, and goes to investigate. He walks into a room to find a red crocodile-like creature mauling up and eating a bird creature. Other people and creatures are just watching.)

Morty: Hey, uh, what the hell?!

Jelly-like creature with items stuck inside of it: Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. (Exits the room)

(Morty is furious. But he hears a creaking noise coming from upstairs. He goes and checks it out. He walks into his parent bedroom to see two people or aliens, presumably having sex in their bed under the covers.)

Morty: Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!

(The covers are lowered to show a blue alien creature with a giant growth on it. It jiggles when he moves.)

Blue alien: Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.

Morty: Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.

(The blue alien pukes on the side of the bed. It disintegrates a giant patch of the mattress.)

Morty: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!

(The screen cuts to the corner of the kitchen. The traflorkians are seen pouring themselves drinks with a beer dispenser. Rick is also there, listening to a half human and half robot person talking to him. Rick is bored out of his mind.)

Gearhead: The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.

Rick: Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally.

(Morty walks up to Rick, stressed out.)

Morty: Rick, you got to stop --

(Rick interrupts Morty, and grabs him.)

Rick: Morty! Have you met Gearhead?

Morty: (Waves) Hey, how's it --

Rick: (Interrupts Morty) Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. (Rick quickly leaves them)

Gearhead: How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?

Morty: Uh... Not at all.

Gearhead: Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago...

(Screen cuts to the outside of the house again. People are seen drunk, some people are still arriving, and there is toilet paper hanging off the roof of the house. A big alien structure is seen on the roof, and one lands just in front of the house. A bunch of cyborg robots exit it and march up to the house.)

(The screen cuts back into the house living room. Rick is by the couch with a large red crab creature. Morty walks up to Rick.)

Rick: Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?

Morty: Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!

(A beer bottle is seen smashing into a wall, making a mess.)

Rick: Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.

(Scropon walks away, moping.)

Rick: Have a little perspective.

(A cat creature walks up to Rick from behind Morty. He's holding some alcohol.)

Squanchy: Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!

Rick: Aw! Squanchy!

Squanchy: Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?

Rick: Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

Squanchy: All right! I like your squanch! (He runs away, excited)

Morty: Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"?

Rick: Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax.

Morty: Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!

Rick: Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?

Morty: Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?

(Time slows down as Jessica dreamily walks into the living room, whipping her hair. People are seen watching her in awe, and a beer bottle is seen being thrown past her.)

Morty: (In slow motion) Jessica.

(Time goes back to normal.)

Rick: Knock it off, Slow Mobius!

(A person/alien wearing yellow clothes and is holding magical wands with clocks on the ends is seen stirring up time with his magic.)

Slow Mobius: Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!

(Jessica walks into a different room.)

Morty: I can't believe she's here.

Rick: Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. (He shoves Morty away. Morty follows Jessica.)

Rick: Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.

(The scene cuts to the titanic. Jerry and Lucy are running together, laughing. They run past a smoking man. Jerry steals his cigarette, and gets rid of it.)

Jerry: Oh, Rose.

(Jerry and Lucy both spin dance together.)

Lucy: Whee!

(Both laughing, as they both look over the balcony at the front of the boat.)

Jerry: Is that what I think it is?

(Screen cuts to the front of the boat, with workers who are stacking painted boards of pieces of the Titanic.)

Lucy: (Off screen) Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.

(Screen cuts back to Jerry and Lucy.)

Lucy: It's so romantic.

Jerry: I can't wait to do that with Beth.

Lucy: I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.

Jerry: (Gasp!) Look! (Points at the iceberg in front of the boat, as it rises higher out of the water)

Voice through speaker: Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.

(Everybody gathers up to the balcony of the boat, watching excitedly.)

Voice through speaker: Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.

(Screen cuts to the bridge of the boat. The two captains watch.)

Captain #1: (Worried) Uh, sir? There's not a problem.

Captain #2: What do you mean there's not a problem?

(The control panel's light are flashing red, and beeping.)

Captain #1: The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!

Captain #2: Well, do something! Steer into it!

Captain #1: (Frantically trying to steer towards the iceberg) I'm trying!

(The boat completely misses the iceberg.)

Captain #2: It's too late. (Removes his hat, and speaks into a microphone.) Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves.

(Everyone on the boat gasp, as they watch the iceberg go past them.)

Jerry: No! What happened?!

Lucy: Their rail system must have failed.

Passengers: Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!

(Screen cuts to the Smith family's house party. A group of fish creatures are seen swimming and jumping into a pool of yellow liquid. But the screen zooms out to show that it turned out to be a cup full of alcohol. A guy picks the cup up.)

Guy: Totally gonna get laid tonight. (Drinks from the cup.)

(Tammy is seen swooning over Birdperson. She is petting his feathers.)

Tammy: (In awe) I like your feathers.

Birdperson: They are designed to attract the attention of the female.

Tammy: It's working.

Birdperson: Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.

Tammy: I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... (Whispers into Birdperson's ear.)

Birdperson: I believe birdperson can arrange that.

(Screen pans to Summer talking to her friends. A girl with glasses walks over to her.)

Nancy: Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.

Girl: Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her.

Summer: (Lying) Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.

(Rick walks up to Summer.)

Rick: Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. (He accidentally splashes some of his drink into Nancy's face.) Everybody should be welcome.

(The wall gets demolished along with a loud explosion. The dust fades, to show a mix between Abradolph Linkler and Adolf Hitler. The house is silent, as he goes around getting aggressive to people.)

Rick: Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? (Tries to hide his face from Abradolph Lincoler.)

Summer: I thought everyone was welcome.

Rick: It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out (burp) it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.

(People run away from Abradolph Lincoler, before he finds Rick.)

Abradolph Lincoler: Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being.

(Rick is drinking his alcohol, unimpressed.)

Abradolph Lincoler: (Walks closer to Rick) But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! (He accidentally bumps Brad with his arm. Brad is standing next to Jessica and Morty)

Brad: Whoa. What's up, man?

Abradolph Lincoler: I have no quarrel with you, boy.

Brad: "Boy"? What's that supposed to mean? (Gets up into Abradolph Lincoler's face)

Abradolph Lincoler: (Threatened) It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... (Looks at Rick for help)

Rick: Don't look at me, dude.

Abradolph Lincoler: Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --

Brad: (Angry) So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!

Abradolph Lincoler: Well, no, but... You know?

Brad: What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?

Jessica: Leave him alone, Brad.

Brad: Stay out of this, Jessica!

Rick: Kick his ass, Brad! (chanting)

Everyone except Morty and Jessica: (Chanting) Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

(Everyone chants, as Brad beats up Abradolph Lincoler.)

Jessica: Brad!

(Jessica leaves the living room, as Morty follows her. Rick follows after Morty.)

Morty: Rick!

Rick: (Shoves Morty towards the door where jessica went) I just did you a favor, Morty.

(Screen cuts to the steps of the front door. Jessica is sitting alone in the messy front yard. The Morty exits through the door.)

Morty: Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.

(A roll of toilet paper falls off the roof, leaving a trail of toilet paper. Morty sits next to Jessica.)

Jessica: (Annoyed) Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.

Morty: Jessica, can I show you something?

(Screen cuts to Morty opening the door to Rick's garage, and switching on the light. Jessica is with morty. The garage is full of constructed devices and stuff.

Jessica: Wow! Look at all this stuff.

Morty: (Walks over to the shelves and picks up a circular device.) Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.

(Morty presses a button on the device, and it projects holograms of the universe and the planets.)

Jessica: It's beautiful.

Morty: You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.

Jesica: What's that, Morty?

Morty: I think that you're the most --

Jessica: No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. (Points at the shaking closet.)

(Morty turns off the device, and hands it to Jessica, as he goes to investigate the closet. He walks over to it, hesitant to open it. He glances at Jessica, before opening it. Inside is Squanchy, Autoerotic asphyxiating himself. (Choking himself with a rope while masturbating.

Jessica: Aah!

Morty: Oh, my God!

Squanchy: Hey, I'm squanching in here!

Morty: Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!

(Morty covers his eyes and backs away, accidentally bumping into a large and tall device, knocking it over.)

Morty: Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

(The glass on the top of the device shatters, as it flashes a bright green light.)

(The screen cuts to the outside of the house, as the green light surrounds the whole house, and it disappears. It leaves a giant hole where the house was.)

(The house teleports into a colorful alien dimension. Everyone shouts in fear due to the impact of the house landing into the ground.)

(The screen cuts to the living room. Everyone is silent, as the power turns back on. Rick turns to look outside the screen door, and opens it. He watches the giant aliens crawl around.)

Rick: Huh. Big star in the sky. (Breathes in) Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. (Turns around, excited) We'll be fine! Let's party!

(A random guy with his t-shirt in hand swings it over his head in excitement. He yells out, as he runs outside, only to be grabbed by an alien and stuffed into it's hole. Most likely it's genitals. Everyone is silent and concerned, so Rick quickly turns on a stereo.)

Stereo: ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪

(Everyone cheers and dances with Rick.)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(Scene cuts back to the outside of the house. Rick, Summer, and Morty are outside the screen door. Rick is holding a device and scanning for something. Everyone is still partying inside.)

Summer: I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.

Rick: Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. (Sips from his drink)

Morty: How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!

Rick: (Holds Morty to get his attention) Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax! (Lets go) It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. (Rick is still scanning with his device. It suddenly starts to beep.) Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.

Morty: Okay. Let's go, then.

(Morty grabs Rick's arm and tries to pull him. Rick gets back up, but he won't follow morty.)

Morty: W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.

Rick: (Makes Morty let go) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?

Summer: Yeah. Me too. I should stay.

(Nancy and Abradolph Lincoler open the screen door and walk through. Abradolph Lincoler is holding a cold soda can up to the side of his face.)

Abradolph Lincoler: You guys have any aspirin?

Rick: Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you.

Abradolph Lincoler: Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.

Rick: Shut up, Lincoler. (Shoves him away) It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.

(Abradolph Lincoler walks away from the house, as Morty follows.)

Summer: (Grabs Nancy's shoulders) Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too.

Nancy: What? Why -- why me?

Summer: Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. (Shoves Nancy towards Morty and Abradolph Lincoler)

(Rick and Summer glance at each other, and enter the house.)

(Screen cuts back to the Titanic. Workers are seen moving the iceberg away, and cleaning up outside.)

(Screen cuts to the inside of the ship. Everyone is at the 'customer service.' Icluding Beth and Jerry.)

Captain #2: Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. (He hands Beth a small card.)

Jerry: (Annoyed) Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken.

Beth: (Sigh) I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. (Walks away from Jerry)

Jerry: But -- but --

(Lucy walks up To Jerry.)

Lucy: You see, Jerry? (She puts her hand on Jerry's shoulder) May I show you something?

(Screen cuts to the storage area of the ship. Lucy and Jerry enter it. It's stocked full of boxes, nets and barrels.)

Lucy: Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.

Jerry: I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure. (Turns to face Lucy) Get it?

(Lucy removes her dress, exposing her naked body.)

Jerry: (Shocked and confused) Ooh!

Lucy: Draw me, Jerry.

Jerry: (Awkwardly glancing at her body) Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind.

Lucy: But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.

Jerry: Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh.

Lucy: (Lifts up a gun she has in her hand, and aims it at Jerry. She walks towards him) You are gonna draw me.

Jerry: Aah! (Backs away)

Lucy: Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there. (Points at an old-fashion car with the gun)

(Screen cuts to a part of the alien dimension that the Smith family's house is stranded in. Abradolph Lincoler, Morty, and Nancy are walking down a path, searching for the crystals. Morty is holding Ricks scanning device.)

Abradolph Lincoler: (Thinking) It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --

Morty: (Interupts him to shut him up) Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close.

Nancy: (Points at big pink crystals growing out of the ground) There they are!

(Morty and Nancy both run to collect some, but are stopped by Abradolph Lincoler.)

Abradolph Lincoler: Wait. Something's not right.

(A big two-headed creature attacks Abradolph Lincoler, knocking him down. Nancy shrieks.)

Abradolph Lincoler: Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! (He lunges at the creature, as he tackles it down. Nancy and Morty quickly grab some crystals and put them in a small bag.)

Nancy: Summer's gonna like me again.

(The creature is still attacking Abradolph Lincoler. It strikes him down. Nancy and Morty watch, concerned.)

(Abradolph Lincoler throws the dead alien creature, as he sits and leans on a giant rock, exhausted. He is suffering from severe bleeding cuts. Morty and Nancy run up to him.)

Morty: Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!

Abradolph Lincoler: Mein journey is over, Morty. (Grunts) I have something important to tell you.

(The screen cuts to the living room. Everyone is listening to Gearhead singing a song while playing his guitar.)

Gearhead: ♪ And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪

(Nancy and Morty run in)

Morty: (Huff) Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! (He hands Rick the bag)

Rick: All right! You did it, Morty. (Walks away)

Morty: Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.

(Nancy tears up)

Morty: He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. (Morty tears up and wipes his eye) He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.

(Nancy comforts Morty)

Rick: Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. (Rick cuts up the crystals into dust with his credit card, and snorts it up. Ricks eyes turn blue) And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something.

(A stereo robot presses a button to play a song. Morty and Nancy watch in confusion.)

Morty: Wait a minute. What?

(A song starts, as Rick prepares himself. Everyone else is watching, bobbing their heads to the beat of the music.)

Rick: (Dancing) ♪ Put your right foot forward ♪ ♪ and your left foot back ♪ ♪ then fucking slide around ♪ ♪ like on a nordictrack ♪

(People start to copy him)

Rick: ♪ move to the left ♪ ♪ step to the right ♪ ♪ wiggle your elbows, and look ♪ ♪ up into the light ♪

Song: ♪ it's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪ ♪ it's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪

(The people who aren't dancing are watching and bobbing their head. Tammy is sitting on Birdperson's lap. They are both enjoying the dance.)

Rick: Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!

(Slow Mobius uses his magic clock wands to mess with time, and to make his dance look cool. A record rewinding can be heard.)

Song: ♪ It's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪

(The song ends.)

(Everyone cheers)

Rick: That's the Rick dance! All right! (burp) Whoa, man!

Morty: What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!

Rick: What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. (His eye color turns back to normal) Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. (He scratches the side of his face)

(Morty takes the bag of crystals and throws them outside. An alien grabs the bag and takes it away)

Morty: That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!

Rick: Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?

(Birdperson shrugs)

Rick: Uh, squanchy?

Squanchy: Don't squaunch at me.

(The alien who took the crystals in seen doing the 'Rick dance' in the background.)

Morty: All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now.

Rick: All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

(Everyone starts booing at Morty.)

Tammy: Boo! You suck, whatever your name is.

Everyone: Boo!

Rick: Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

(Morty walks away, angry.)

Gearhead: But these gears just started turnin'.

(The scene cuts back to the Titanic. Nervous Jerry is drawing Lucy onto a notebook.)

Lucy: Almost finished, Jerry?

Jerry: Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.

Lucy: (Still holding the gun) I'm sure it's good enough. Move!

(Screen cuts to the old-fashion car. Jerry and Lucy walk up to it.)

Lucy: Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. (She licks the car, as the floor of the car detatches.) But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me.

(Lucy shoves Jerry into the car. He whines in fear, as he clutches onto his drawing on the notebook.)

Lucy: No mess. No clean.

(A book is thrown at Lucy, knocking her out. Beth threw it.)

Jerry: (Reieved) Beth!

Beth: Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.

(Jerry runs over to Beth, hugging her. He throws the notebook with his drawing onto Lucy, as a few men, including the tour guide.)

(Screen cuts to the parking lot of the Titanic getaway. Jerry and Beth are outside their car, while Jerry is packing their stuff into the back.)

Beth: I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

Jerry: What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? (Feeling scared due to a flashback)

Beth: What?

(Jerry glances around, not answering.)

Beth: Well, at least you got all this free stuff. (She enters the door into the drivers seat, as Jerry closes the back door, and tries to fit a painting board from the titanic boat.)

Beth: Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.

Jerry: (Puts the board into the passenger seat) Ugh! I'm not going to fit. (Hangs onto the board, recreating Jack's death from the Titanic movie. He slowly slips off) Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and --

Beth: (Interrupts Jerry) Jerry, just leave the door.

Jerry: It's not a door, Beth. It's debris.

Beth: I don't care. Just leave it.

Jerry: Yeah. Okay. (He takes out the board and leaves it on the ground, as he gets into the car. He has Lucy's necklace. He drops it out of the car window. Lucy is seen hanging onto the underneath of their car. The car starts moving)

Lucy: Ahahahah! "Cape fear"! Hahahaha! "Cape fear"! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from "cape fear".

(Lucy accidentally lets go and gets run over by the car.)

Lucy: Ugh! Auh! Augh! (huff) (huff)

(Lucy is bleeding and very injured. She moans in pain, trying to crawl.)

(Screen cuts to where the hole is where Smith family's house was, as it teleports back there. People and aliens are seen leaving the house.)

Squanchy: Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!

(Everyone cheers on with Squanchy. Brad and Jessica are seen exiting the house too. Brad's arm is around Jessica. Morty sees this, shocked.)

Summer: Cool. I'm coming, too.

Squanchy: (Stops Summer) Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.

Summer: What?

Squanchy: Nancy told us what a bitch you are. (Leaves)

(Nancy follows everyone else.)

Summer: Guys, seriously. Nancy?

Nancy: Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for.

(Nancy leaves out the door, and Morty slams the door, mad.)

(The house is completely trashed. Rick flops onto the couch and falls asleep, while Summer sits on the small couch. Morty picks up a garbage bag and tries to clean up the mess.)

Summer: Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. (To Rick) You're so wise.

Rick: (Groan) (Mumbles) Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... (Rick falls asleep, snoring)

(Birdperson is at the entrance to the back yard. Morty walks up to him as Birdperson hands him a piece of trash.)

Birdperson: May I assist you with that?

Morty: Uh, sure, yeah. (Takes the trash and puts it in the garbage bag) Thanks. (Continues to pick up trash)

Birdperson: Morty, do you know what "wubba lubba dub dub" means?

Morty: Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.

Birdperson: (Walks up to Morty) It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, "I am in great pain. Please help me."

Morty: Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically.

(Summer gets up from the couch and walks away.)

(Morty walks over to the giant hole that's blasted into the wall. Birdperson follows.)

Birdperson: No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.

Morty: Come on, um...

Birdperson: Birdperson.

Morty: Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.

Birdperson: Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.

Morty: You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.

(Morty walks into the kitchen and throws the garbage bag on the floor. Summer is seen cleaning up the table by removing empty cups.)

Morty: I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.

Birdperson: My people have another saying-- "gubba nub nub doo rah kah". It means, "whatever lets you sleep at night".

(Summers phone sounds a notification. She checks it.)

Summer: Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.

Birdperson: This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!

(Tammy jumps onto his back, and he takes flight.)

Birdperson: Caw!

(Morty looks out the window to see Beth and Jerry's car drive around the corner and towards the house. He looks back to Rick, who is still napping.)

Summer: Wow. We are so screwed.

Morty: (Walks over to Rick, and shakes him) Rick, wake up.

Rick: Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.

Morty: Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home.

Rick: Augh. Uh, all -- all right. (Sits up and grabs a glass of water sitting on the coffee table.) All right. Hold -- hold on. (He drinks from the glass) Ahh! So good.

(Morty looks out the window again.)

Morty: Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway.

Rick: Bring me the thing.

Morty: What -- what thing?

Rick: (Rubbing his forehead and focusing) The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps.

Morty: Rick! That describes everything in your garage!

Summer: (Walks up to Rick with a remove device) Do you mean this?

Rick: Summer (burp) for for the win.

(Rick presses a button on the device, as orange rays of light flash.)

Rick: All right, that should do it.

Morty: Whoa! What did you do?

Rick: Uh, s-see for yourself.

(Morty and Summer walk out of the house to discover that Rick has paused time. Beth and Jerry are stuck in place, and nothing is moving.)

Summer: Whoa!

Rick: Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that.

Morty: For how long?

(Summer waves her hand in Jerry's face to get his attention. He doesn't respond.)

Rick: I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?

Summer: Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?

(The scene cuts to multiple scenes of a montage of Rick, Morty, and Summer doing stuff together and having fun.)

(They are seen cleaning up the living room. Morty vacuuming, Summer wiping down a coffee table, and Rick sweeping.)

(The scene cuts to the three painting the now repaired wall. As Rick turns around, he accidentally flicks some paint onto Summer. The three then start flicking paint at each other for fun.)

(The scene cuts to Rick, Morty and Summer carving pumpkins, and placing them onto Beth and Jerry's heads)

(The scene cuts to the three running down a busy street, pulling the people's pants down, exposing them.)

(The scene cuts to the three running into Best Buy, and taking a new TV.)

(The scene cuts to Rick, Morty and Summer watching the Titanic on their new TV outside. The movie just ended.)

Rick: Worst movie ever.

Summer: Dumb.

Morty: Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.

(Everyone realises the joke, and laugh together.)

Morty: Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen.

Summer: This has been so much fun.

Morty: Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say.

Rick: Don't need to. I have a (burp) new catchphrase.

Morty: Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?

Rick: love my grandkids.

Morty and Summer in unison: (Hug Rick) Aww.

Rick: Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, "I don't give a fuck".

(Rick turns on a radio, as he sings the lyrics, and dances. Morty and Summer join in.)

Rick and the song: ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ ♪ just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ Roll credits! ♪ Just shake that a-- Roll the credits! Go! ♪ Just shake that ass That's the end of season one!

(The screen zooms out.)

Rick: That's the end, motherfucker! "I don't give a fuck" is my new catchphrase! Fuck you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, motherfucker! Yeah!

(CREDITS)

(END CREDITS SCENE)

(Abradolph Lincoler is seen still dead on the rock. But he opens his eyes.)

Abradolph Lincoler: Revenge.

(Abradolph Lincoler gets picked up by an alien.)

Abradolph Lincoler: What?!

(The alien stuffs him into it's hole. Another alien comes up to him, and takes the shirtless guy out of it's hole.)

Shirtless guy: Party!

(The other one pulls Abradolph Lincoler back out of it's hole, and they swap people with their holes. More aliens show up as they join in on it. Abradolph Lincoler and the shirtless guy are going back and forth into the aliens.)

Shirtless guy: Whoo, baby!

Abradolph Lincoler: Please, stop!

Shirtless Guy: Hey, brah!

Abradolph Lincoler: I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?

Shirtless Guy: Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!

[Open aerial view/zoom on Morty’s House]

(Morty, Rick, and Jerry)

(Everything is frozen besides Morty, Rick and Summer. Morty is vacuuming Jerry with a hand vac.)

(Enter: Summer)

Summer: Hurry up Morty, Grampa’s about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.

Morty: I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I’ve been doing it for six months!

Summer: Then you’ve been doing it wrong for six months. Oh my god is that mildew?

Morty: It’s not my fault we froze time on a humid day!

Summer: You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?

Morty: What? What kind of monster are you?

Summer: A competent one.

Rick: Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about. The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a *ck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let’s get this dumb universe rolling. Let’s do this thing.

(Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.)

Rick: Alright, listen you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world’s time is gonna be fine, but our time’s gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.

Morty: Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?

Rick: It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don’t touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.

Morty: Wait a minute, what?

Rick: And away we go!

(Rick unfreezes time.)

(Mr. Benson falls off the roof.)

Morty: Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?

Rick: Shhh, Morty!

(Jerry opens the door angrily)

Jerry: …A THING OR TWO ABOUT… wait, what? Was the house…? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.

Rick: Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you’re at. Hi, sweety.

Beth: Hi, dad.

(Summer and Morty recoil from Beth as she approaches to hug Rick)

Beth: Summer, Morty, are you okay?

Morty: W-We just missed you a lot.

Summer: Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.

(Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.)

Rick: Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don’t you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here’s five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I’m just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.

Jerry: This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won’t save you. I’ll get my jacket.

Beth: Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?

<Simultaneously---

Summer: *Gasp*

Morty: Oh!

Rick: Uh oh.

-------------->

Jerry: Yeah, I like it this way. I’m not stupid.

<Simultaneously---

Morty: Phew…

Summer: *Exhales*

-------------->

Rick: Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what’s going on. (Morty and Summer laugh) Oh you agree, huh? (Summer: Funny) You like that Red Grin Grumble reference? (Summer: Yeah.) Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father’s children. Think for yourselves, don’t be sheep.

[Intro sequence]

[Trans. Outside Morty’s house]

(Mr. Benson is being loaded into an ambulance.)

[Trans. Inside Morty’s house]

Summer: God, I feel terrible.

Rick: Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. (Rick opens refrigerator) [Trans. Inside refrigerator] One minute you’re falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!

[Trans. Inside Morty’s house]

Morty: Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer’s job to put the mattress under-

Summer: (interrupting) Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. (Summer pokes Morty.)

Morty: Nuh uh!

Summer: Yeah huh!

Rick: Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank’s money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.

Morty: Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.

Summer: Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!

Morty: You shut up you big… female asshole!

(Alternate selves first appear)

Alternate Morty: Hey, don’t shove me!

Summer: I didn’t!

Morty: You didn’t what?

Alternate Summer: What’s your problem?

Morty: What’s yours?

Alternate Summer: Shut up!

Morty: You shut up!

Rick: Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?

(Time splits into two - alternate timelines will be ordered from top to bottom, left to right.)

All Ricks: Oh god, oh no, what did you guys just do?

Summer 1: What do you mean?

Summer 2: What could we do?

All Summers: Wait, what am I saying?

Rick: *belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?

All Mortys: Oh man… I don’t feel good.

Morty 1: Am I me? I think so.

Morty 2: A-am I talking right now?

All Mortys: Wait, who said that?

All Ricks: Alright both of you, just don’t move, don’t speak, don’t think. I have to check something.

Summer 1: What should we do Morty?

Summer 2: I’m gonna help Grampa.

Morty 1: Let’s see if he needs help.

Morty 2: What do you mean you’re gonna help him.

Summer 1: Ugh, I can help too.

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage]

All Mortys: What’s going on Rick?

All Summers: What’s happening Grampa?

All Ricks: Shut up! (Rick turns on a monitor) Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!

Morty 1: What do you mean?

Morty 2: What? In English?

Summer 1: What? English please?

Summer 2: What are you talking about?

All Ricks: Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that’s split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we’re exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We’re entirely hypothetical.

All Mortys: But I thought there were infinite timelines.

All Ricks: We’re not on any timeline, dummy. Look.

(Rick opens the garage door, revealing floating cats, trees and islands.)

All Mortys: Oh my god!

All Summers: Are those cats?

All Ricks: I assume they’re Schrodinger’s cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren’t, just like us.

Summer 1 & Morty 2: Is the world gone? Where are Mom and Dad?

All Ricks: “Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family’s ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They’re probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.

[Trans. Inside Jerry’s car]

Jerry: Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?

Beth: You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.

(Jerrry hits a deer.)

Beth: Holy shit! What happened?

Jerry: I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.

Beth: W-what?

Jerry: This is Rum Raisin!

(Beth hands Jerry her ice cream, gets out of the car and goes over to the deer.)

Beth: It’s still alive.

Jerry: Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or-

Beth: It’s not an armadillo, asshole!

Jerry: I thought that’s what a man’s supposed to say, it’s not like I could have actually done it.

Beth: If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-

Jerry: It’s okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you’re a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.

Beth: So…

Jerry: Well don’t different animals-

Beth: Require different levels of skill to keep alive?

Jerry: Oh god…

Beth: Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

Jerry: Yes Beth.

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage]

All Ricks: This is why you don’t freeze time, you guys. It’s incredibly irresponsible.

Morty 1: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.

Morty 2: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?

All Ricks: Look, there’s no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn’t. And we’ve got about four hours to be “is”.

Morty 1: Or…

Morty 2: Or?

All Ricks: We “isn’t”

All Ricks: Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it’s impossible that I didn’t nail this, I’m probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.

Morty 1 & Summer 2: How do you know you’re gonna-

All Ricks: Whatever you’re asking, the answer is I’m amazing. And away we go!

(Rick presses a button, the timelines almost merge)

Rick: Huh, what do you know, it’s working

Summer 1: Ow, ow ouch!

Morty 2: Whoa, ow, ow.

Rick: Oh shit.

(Realities separate again)

All Ricks: What the hell is wrong with you two!? I-I m- I m- I mean you 4!?

All Mortys and Summer 2: That hurt! That was painful…

All Ricks: Good I’m glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you’re both *belch* all over the damn place. We’ve been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!

All Mortys: Well you don’t exactly make it easy, Rick!

Morty 1: You make fun of me all the time and now Summer’s doing it too!

Morty 2: You’re always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!

Summer 1: Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!

Summer 2: Me? You’re just as mean to me because you’re jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!

All Ricks: Alright, cool it, I see what’s happening here. You’re both young, you’re both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa’s favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa’s concerned, you’re both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.

[Trans. Outside animal hospital.]

[Trans. Inside animal hospital.]

Beth: Emergency, wounded deer coming in.

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

(Vet is taking a snake’s pulse.)

Vet: 3. Excuse me, you can’t be back here.

Beth: I’m a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.

Vet: That’s my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I’m sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-

Beth: As a vet, I’m sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let’s save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it’s time to save a life!

Vet: Geez…

(Vet removes Snake from operating table. Beth and Jerry place deer on operating table.)

Beth: That’s odd, this deer’s wounded.

Jerry: Uh, yeah, I was there, you don’t have to rub it in.

Beth: I mean it’s been shot. With a gun.

Hunter: My gun.

Vet: May I help you, sir?

Hunter: No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me.

Beth: *sigh* We don’t have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline!

Vet: Look, I don’t know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal.

Hunter: I’m calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you’re as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

Beth: In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage.]

All Ricks: So in conclusion, you’re both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can’t tell the two of you half the time because I don’t go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?

All Mortys and All Summers: Yes.

All Ricks: Alright, perfect. Sit still, *belch* arms down, I’m gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.

Morty 2: You mean drunk?

Rick 1: And away we go!

Rick 2: What’s that? You got something to say?

Morty 2: No.

Rick 2: And away we go!

All Ricks: Huh, that’s weird. Oh my god.

All Summers: What?

All Ricks: That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!

Rick 2: Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don’t you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it’s easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it’s always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now…

Rick 1: Don’t you get it? don’t you get it? The other Rick isn’t trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it’s easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it’s always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now…

All Mortys: Rick what the hell are you doing?

All Ricks: Saving our lives. After he takes me out he’s gonna be coming for you!

All Summers: Who?

All Ricks: Me!

Rick 2: You see that? Get down.

All Summers: Ahh!

All Mortys: Whoa whoa!

Rick 1: I told you he’s a psycho!

Rick 2: He’s lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy!

Rick 1: I don’t know what to do! I don’t know what to do!

Summer 2 or 4 after splitting into 4 (not shown): Oh crap!

(Reality splits into 4 parts)

All Ricks: Oh god, now there’s three of them, we’re outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don’t don’t do that, they’ll know… wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don’t really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK *CKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

Beth: You son of a bitch, you don’t stop living until I SAY SO!

Lawyer: Michael.

Vet: Who’s this now?

Hunter: My lawyer.

Lawyer: I’m here to notify you ma’am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter’s property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies. It’s called Brad’s law. We can’t make you stop the surgery, but at this point you’re performing it on venison.

Hunter: Actually, I’ve decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict. I’m sure it’s ruined the meat. I’m just gonna use the head for my rec room wall.

Jerry: She normally works on horses.

Beth: Jerry, if you’re not gonna help, get the *ck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!

Vet: Jesus…

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage.]

All Ricks: Shh shh… I know where you are, you creepy old monster… I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I’m going? You think I’m standing here? Well maybe you’re right!

(Morty knocks Rick out with a fire extinguisher)

All Summers: Holy shit, now what?

All Mortys: Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn’t that mean that we’re all synchronized?

All Summers: Right.

All Mortys: Okay… so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.

All Summers: Right…

All Mortys: I think I’m certain we’re F’d in the A.

[Cut to black]

[Trans. Outside the house in Schrodinger cat space]

All Ricks: Oh god, my head. What did you guys do?

All Mortys: We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.

All Summers: You tried to kill yourself!

All Ricks: Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don’t expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we’ve got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it’s basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.

All Summers: Well is there some way you can prove you’re not a threat to yourself and others anymore?

All Ricks: Ah, for god’s sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.

All Mortys: W-what’re you doing?

All Ricks: Calling myself. Here, listen, *belch* it’ll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I’m calling myself.

All Rick phones: Hello, Rick here.

All Ricks: Don’t fall for it, it’s a bit.

All Rick phones: Just kidding, haha! You just got Ricked. You’ve reached Rick’s voicemail, you know what to do *beep*.

All Ricks: Hey Rick, it’s Rick. Listen, I’m sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I’m blown up. Three new voicemails. *voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one. *voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we’re cool now.

All Summers: Okay, well we’re still not gonna let you out of this crate.

All Ricks: Fine I’ll just do it myself.

All Mortys: If you could get out that whole time why didn’t you?

All Ricks: Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That’s the difference between you and me. I’m certain, and you’re a walking burlap sack filled with turds.

All Mortys: You know, geez Rick, y—y—you’re really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.

(Testicle Monster A floats into view in a bubble.)

Morty 1: Oh my god!

Morty 2: It’s a monster!

Morty 3: Oh my god! It’s a monster!

Summer 1: It’s a monster!

Summer 4: It’s a monster!

Testicle Monster A: Ey, ye ey, quit yellin’ quit yellin’.

Summer 1: *Screams*

Summer 4: Oh my god…

Morty 2, 3 and 4: *Screams*

Testicle Monster A: What the *ck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!

All Ricks: *sigh*

Testicle Monster A: How did this happen?

Summers 2 & 3: Yeah, but we don’t even know, the first time…

Morty 1 & 4: Who’s that Brother Newman time elf?

Testicle Monster A: Shut the *ck up! Oh, damn, I’m from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o’ y’all. Now let’s just see what we got here for a second.

All Ricks:' *'groan*

Testicle Monster A: Ay, damn it, were you tryin’ to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you’re standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?

All Mortys: Oh way to go, Rick.

All Summers: Yeah Grampa, way to go.

All Ricks: Oh, what you’re just gonna listen to this guy now? He’s got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.

Testicle Monster A: Shut up. Here, put these on. They’ll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y’all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!

Summer 1, 2 and 3: What are you talking about?

Morty 1, 2 and 3: We have them on.

Rick 1, 2 and 3: Uh, we did…

Rick 4: We’re not wearing collars.

Testicle Monster A: Exactly, because you’re being obstinate.

Rick 1, 2 and 3: *belch* What?

Morty 1, 2 and 3: We did!

Summer 1, 2 and 3: They’re on right now.

Rick 4: Alright, fine. Summer, Morty, put ‘em on.

(Alternate timelines merge into one)

Rick: Yes, we’re back, problem solved.

Summer: Yes, we’re back to our own time.

Morty: Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.

Testicle Monster A: Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don’t break your weak ass time again.

Rick: How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They’re really embarassing.

Testicle Monster A: Well since you’re goin’ to time prison, I’d say you can keep em on forever.

Summer: Time prison?

Testicle Monster A: Yeah, well I don’t know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin’ ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen.

Summer: You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?

Rick: I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don’t exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there’s a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!

Testicle Monster A: Ututututut! You’d better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

Vet: Hmm…

Beth: Isn’t there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?

Lawyer: That’s right Mrs. Smith, *whispers* give in to your anger. Neglect that deer.

Jerry: Honey, it’s gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country’s top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.

Vet: I guess that’s the end of that.

Lawyer: There is just one more thing. According to this state’s veterinarian statute, this animal can’t be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn’t hack it.

Jerry: We did it…

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage.]

Testicle Monster A: (On phone) Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I’m talking ‘bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you’ve get to the dolphin people you’ve gone too far. Alright man, I’ll talk to you later, okay. (hangs up) You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.

Morty: Why are you doing this?

Testicle Monster A: You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin’ you guys in is my ticket up.

Rick: What if I told you there’s a huge ticket up right behind you?

Testicle Monster A: You really think I’m that stupid?

Rick: Alright, hear me out on this. You’re immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there’s 100% chance that you’ll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.

Testicle Monster A: I cannot argue that.

(Rick hits the creature with a wrench and grabs the organic gun he was holding)

Rick: Ah, god, gross and weird!

(Rick drops the gun and it crawls toward the street)

Testicle Monster A: Chris!

(The gun/Chris runs into the road and is run over by a car)

Testicle Monster A: You killed my gun!

Rick: Summer, Morty, take off your collars!

Testicle Monster A: What? What the hell are you doing?

Rick: Good question. I suppose the answer is: I’m not certain!

Testicle Monster A: Oh, no, what are you doin’?

(Time splits into 2 timelines)

Rick 1: I have no idea!

Rick 2: I’m not sure.

(Time splits into 4 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): Maybe I will, maybe I won’t.

(Time Splits into 8 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): I’m really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass!

Testicle Monster A: Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago.

All Summers (off sync): Come on, let’s help Grampa.

All Mortys (off sync): Yeah. I’m like a hundred percent not sure about anything.

(Time splits twice, now 32 Timelines)

Summers 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20, 25, 28, 29, 31: Beat his ass!

Summers 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 25, 27, 28: Get him!

Summers 2, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32: Beat him up!

(Zooms in to only show one timeline: Timeline 23)

Morty 23: Kick his ass Rick!

(Ricks, Mortys, and Summers hit Testicle Monster A one last time, he falls back and his head explodes.)

Testicle Monster A: Ow, I’m defeated…

Summer 23: What’s happening?

Rick 23: Time is falling apart, we’ve got to get back to certainty, quick! Give me your collars!

Morty 23: Oh man, don’t you have to fix like, thirty of them?

Rick 23: Morty, I have to fix three of them, and then there’s thirty-one other versions of me that have to also fix three for a total of 96. I’m not an idiot. I know how to be decisive, now hand me that (Phillips/Flathead) screwdriver. Actually, make it a (Phillips/Flathead).

(Time splits into 64 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): Oh, shit.

[Trans. Inside Jerry’s car]

Jerry: Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it’s my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.

Beth: Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal’s life than my own ego?

Jerry: Hmm… you’d have to be pretty petty. But you’d still be the woman I married.

Beth: Where are we going?

Jerry: One last stop.

Beth: Where’s the helicopter?

Jerry: There is no helicopter, and there is no Cervine Institute.

Beth: But the top deer surgeon…

Jerry: I’m looking at her. Thanks for F.D.’ing me up like that.

Cold Stone Employee: You’d better get moving, these lights are designed for basic ice cream work, they’re not gonna last all night.

Beth: I need 5 minutes.

(Short slow-panning montage of surgery)

Beth: Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I’ve ever had.

Jerry: Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.

Cold Stone Employee: You’re welcome.

[Trans. Inside Rick’s garage.]

(Zoom in to Timeline 30)

(Presumably) All Ricks: Okay, we’re out of time. It’s ironic, huh?

Morty 30: Rick!

Rick 30: What’s goin’ on?

Morty 30: The collar, oh, the latch is broken! It won’t latch closed around my neck!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 28)

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: What’s wrong, how come our collars aren’t green?

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Obviously because someone doesn’t know how to put his collar on and one of me is stuck trying to help him.

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: Don’t blame this on me, you’re the one that couldn’t fix a latch!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)

Rick 30: What are you talking about, it’s not broken, Morty, I fixed it, just put it on!

Morty 30: It won’t close, it’s broken!

Rick 30: Fine, bring it here.

Morty 30: Ooh, ooh, Rick!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 15)

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Oh, really, Morty? Well I’m sorry, I’m not the one that’s so *cking uncertain about everything!

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: You know what I’m certain of, Rick? I’ve really made up my mind about this, I never wanna see you again!

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: You’re never gonna see anything again you little dummy! You killed us!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)

Rick 30: God, damn it!

Morty 30: Ooh

Rick 30: Morty where’s your collar I’ll fix it

Morty 30: I dropped it

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: What the hell? What have you done to me Morty?

Rick 30: I’m okay with this. Be good Morty. Be better than me. Bullsh*t The other collar! I’m not okay with this! I am not okay with this! Oh sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh my god I—I’ve gotta fix this thing, please God in Heaven, please God oh Lord, hear my prayers. Yes, *ck you God, not today bitch.

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Please God if there’s a Hell, please be merciful to me.

Rick 30: Yes I did it! There is no God. In your face. One dot, mother*ckers!

Morty: Yes, oh, yes, yes!

Summer: Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!

Morty: Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.

Rick: You know what I’m talking about, oh yeah. I’m gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I’m doing the cabbage patch dance. It’s a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.

Morty: Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.

Summer: Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?

Morty: I don’t know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn’t work. It’s hard to keep straight now that I have sixty three other memories of everything.

Rick: Yeah.

Morty: But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.

Rick: Shut up Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.

Beth: Hey guys, we’re home.

(Summer and Morty run up and hug Beth and Jerry, respectively.)

Morty & Summer: Mom, Dad!

Jerry: Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?

Beth: *laughs*

Jerry: Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they’re just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.

Beth: *laughing* I’m gonna pee my pants.

Morty: Doesn’t feel so good does it?

Rick: No it doesn’t. It hurts.

Beth: I’m gonna pee-hee-hee.

Jerry: Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90’s? What is this a 90’s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?

[Trans. Testicle Monster travelling through time, stops at ice age with a wooly mammoth in the background.]

Testicle Monster A: Hey man, when the hell were you?

Testicle Monster B: Looking for you, asshole.

Testicle Monster A: I told you past the dinosaurs.

Testicle Monster B: You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time!

Testicle Monster A: Come on man, it’s this way…

Testicle Monster B: Come on, give me that thing, speed it up, he can’t be this far back.

[Monster A spots a man that looks Rick writing on a chalkboard]

Testicle Monster A: There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop.

[Man who looks like Rick turns around; it turns out to be Albert Einstein]

Testicle Monster B: So that’s the guy, huh?

Testicle Monster A: Yeah, that’s him. Hey, man, remember me? [him and Monster B starts beating up Einstein, knocking him to the ground] I got something for your ass! You don’t mess with time! You don’t f*** with time, mother****er! [him and Monster B leaves]

Albert Einstein: I vill mess vith time!

[Einstein gets up and determinately writes E=MC2 in the chalkboard]

Albert Einstein: I vill mess vith time…
