Rick," Morty, you got to come on. You got to come with me."
Morty," Rick, what’s going on?"
Rick," I got a surprise for you, Morty."
Morty, It’s the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Rick, I got a surprise for you.
Morty, Ow! Ow! You’re tugging me too hard.
Rick," I got a surprise for you, Morty."
Rick," What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage."
Morty," Yeah, Rick, it’s great. Is this the surprise?"
Rick," Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."
Morty, What?! A bomb?!
Rick," We’re gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start."
Morty, T-t-that’s absolutely crazy!
Rick," Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It’s gonna be good. Right now, we’re gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."
Morty, Jessica? From my math class?
Rick," When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I’m gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you’re gonna be Adam."
Morty, Whoa.
Rick," And Jessica’s gonna be Eve,…"
Morty, Whhhh-wha?
Rick," And so that’s the surprise, Morty."
Morty," No, you can’t! Jessica doesn’t even know I exist but but forget about that, because you can’t blow up humanity."
Rick," I-I get what you’re trying to say, Morty. Listen, I’m not you don’t you don’t got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I’m I’m not that kind of guy, Morty."
Morty," What are you talking about, Rick?"
Rick," You you don’t have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she’s all for you, Morty."
Morty," I don’t care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You’re right."
Rick," Let’s forget the girl all together. She she’s probably nothing but trouble, anyways."
Robot Voice, Arming neutrino bomb.
Morty," That’s it that’s it, Rick. I’m taking the wheel."
Rick," Get off of me, Morty!"
Morty," I’m taking charge of this situation, buddy. What’s gotten into you? I’m I’m I’m I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world."
Rick," All right, all right. I’ll I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden."
Rick," We’ll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here."
Morty," Oh, thank God."
Rick," You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
Morty, It was?
Rick," Sure. Why not? I don’t know. You you know what, mo-"
Robot Voice, Neutrino bomb armed.
Morty, Um…
Jerry, I see there’s a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
Summer," Oh, my God, his head is in his food. I’m going to puke."
Beth," Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow. The dog sleeps on it."
Morty," I wasn’t kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."
Summer, Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.
Rick," What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
Jerry, Damn it!
Jerry, Beth!
Summer," Oh, my God, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
Rick," Mm, there is no God, Summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You’ll thank me later."
Jerry," Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
Rick," Listen, Jerry, I don’t want to overstep my bounds or anything. It’s your house. It’s your world. You’re a real Julius Caesar but I’ll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It’s a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it’s it’s not a place for smart people, Jerry and I know that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s my two cents on the issue."
Rick," This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
Jerry, What? For real?
 Goldenfold," All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we’re gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It’s called math and without it, none of us would even exist, so let’s jump right in. 2 plus 2."
All classmates except Morty, 4.
Morty, Jessica.
 Goldenfold, 5 plus 5.
All classmates except Morty, 10.
Morty, Jessica.
 Goldenfold," Okay, good. It’s time for the quiz."
Jessica," Hi, Morty."
Morty," Whoa! Hi, Jessica."
Jessica, Can I show these to you?
Morty, Wow. Th-they’re both great.
Jessica, Thank you. You know what I named these? My little Morties.
Morty," Uh, that’s flattering and a little weird."
Jessica, Do you know what I want you to do with them?
Morty, Rename them?
Jessica," Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
Morty," Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let’s give this a shot."
Jessica," Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?"
Morty," Uh, I-I’m just doing my best."
 Goldenfold, Morty!
Morty, Jessica.
Morty, Je-Jessica. Jessica.
 Goldenfold, Not my fault this is happening.
Frank," Well, well, well."
Frank," ""Morning""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family’s poor?"
Morty," Oh, geez, Frank. I don’t know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
Frank," You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I’m gonna cut you, ‘cause my family’s rich."
Rick," There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what’d you do to Frank?"
Rick," It’s pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (Belch) It’s important. Come on, Morty."
Morty," I don’t know, Rick. I can’t leave school again."
Rick," Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
Morty," Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn’t you unfreeze him?"
Rick," I’ll do it later, Morty. He’ll be fine. Let’s go."
Summer," Hi, Frank. (Frank’s frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying) AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!"
Beth, Scalpel. Davin: Scalpel.
Jerry," (enters the room) Knock, knock."
Beth, Jerry?
Jerry," My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"""
Beth," Jerry, please tell me you’re here for an incredibly urgent reason."
Jerry," Well, it’s lunch. I mean, it’s one of three meals that have existed for millennia."
Beth," Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
Jerry," Well, yeah, on horses."
Beth," Hey, Tom! We know when we’re losing him. (At the top of her lungs) WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"
Rick," There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let’s go."
Morty," Oh, geez, okay."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?"
Rick," It’s Dimension 35-C, and it’s got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there’s fruit in those trees, and there’s seeds in those fruits. I’m talking about mega seeds. They’re they’re incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick. I’m looking around this place, and I’m starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
Rick," All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You’re looking around, and it’s all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that’s how we grow as people. I’m no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we’re gonna be-"
Rick," I never seen that thing before in my life. I don’t even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It’s gonna kill us! We’re gonna die! We’re gonna die, Morty!"
Rick," Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That’s the smell of adventure, Morty. That’s-that’s the smell of of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
Morty," All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn’t I be back at school by now?"
Rick," Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. (A weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) What the hell is that thing? You think you’re gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic, that thing."
Morty," Yeah, Rick, I get it. We’re surrounded by monsters. That’s kind of the reason why I want to leave."
Rick," Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?"
Rick," You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?"
Morty, The mega trees?
Rick," That’s right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that’s what I’m talking about, Morty. That’s where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you’re so in love with school."
Morty," All right, all right. So, what’s so special about these seeds, anyways?"
Rick," You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an (belch) Under (belch) underfoot figure."
Rick," Just take these shoes, Morty. They’re (belch) special grappling shoes. When you’re wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
Morty, AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
Rick," You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!"
Beth," I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month’s Victoria’s secret?"
Jerry," I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine’s day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
Davin," Everything cool in here, Beth?"
Beth," It’s fine, Davin."
Davin," Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There’s nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse."
Jerry," Since we’re fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
Beth," Look, I appreciate the stress you’re under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend."
Beth," Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I’m my father’s daughter. I’m smart. Why do you think I’m a heart surgeon?"
Jerry," (Cough) Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
Principal Vagina," Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty’s father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"
Rick," Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on (Offscreen) your legs right now. You know, you got to turn (Onscreen) the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
Morty," I’m in a lot of pain, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you’ll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?"
Rick," Okay, hold on just a second, Morty."
Morty, Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
Rick," Don’t worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"
Morty," Sure thing, Rick."
Rick," Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (Offscreen) The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
Morty," Wow, that’s pretty crazy, Rick."
Rick," There’s just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that (belch) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. (belch) It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it’s got no charge left, Morty. It’s got no charge left."
Morty, What?!
Rick," It’s as good as garbage, Morty. It’s not gonna work anymore, Morty."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick, that’s not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?"
Rick," There’s ways to get back home, Morty. It’s just it’s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We’re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you’re gonna have to do me a real solid."
Morty, Uh-oh.
Rick," When we get to customs, I’m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I’m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."
Morty, In my butt?
Rick," Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. I really don’t want to have to do that."
Rick," Well, somebody’s got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren’t gonna get through customs unless they’re in someone’s rectum, Morty"
Morty, Uuuh.
Rick," And they’ll fall right out of mine. I’ve done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you’re young. Y-y-you’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y(belch)-you’ve got to put these seeds inside your butt."
Morty, In my butt?
Rick," Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty."
Morty," Oh, man."
Principal Vagina," The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
Beth, What? Why didn’t you notify us?
Principal Vagina, I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I’ve been leaving with Morty’s grandfather?
Jerry," Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?"
Principal Vagina," Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it’s usually Morty’s grandpa that’s taking him out of school."
Beth, Summer?
Principal Vagina, We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. (chuckles) And there’s no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won’t let them.
Announcer, The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
Alien," So, I told him, ""give me the blimfarx,"" you know? This this guy he doesn’t understand interstellar currency."
Alien," It’s, like, I’m trying to eat a flimflam like, that’s what we eat on girvonesk."
Announcer, The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
Rick," I don’t like it here, Morty. I can’t abide bureaucracy. I don’t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?"
Morty," Yeah, Rick. Let’s just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy."
Rick," That means they’re good ones. You’re a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You’ve been a huge help to me. I’m gonna be able to do a-(Belch)-all kind of things with them. It’s gonna be great, Morty. A-(Belch)-all kinds of science."
Gromfomite," Okay, next through. (Stops Morty) Except you. You go over there."
Rick, Why does he have to go over there?
Gromfomite, Random check. He’s got to go through the new machine.
Rick, What new (Belch) what new machine?
Gromfomite, It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
Rick," Run, Morty! Run!"
Morty, Aaaaaah!
Gromfomite, Red alert!
Morty, Ohhhhh!
Morty, Ohhhhhh!
Rick, Don’t think about it!
Rick," Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher."
Morty, Whoooooo!
Alien," Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I’m just trying to-"
Rick," I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me."
Morty," Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don’t want to shoot nobody."
Rick," They’re just robots, Morty! It’s okay to shoot them! They’re robots!"
Glenn, Aaaaah! My leg is shot off!
Other Gromfomite, Glenn’s bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children!
Morty," They’re not robots, Rick!"
Rick," It’s a figure of speech, Morty. They’re bureaucrats. I don’t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!"
Morty, Holy crap! This is insane!
Rick," Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!"
Jessica, Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
Jessica," You’re Morty, right?"
Rick," You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass."
Rick," Oh, hi, Jerry. (poorly acting) Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior… No? No takers?"
Rick, You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It’s beyond your reasoning.
Rick, Takes one to know one.
Rick, What-what are you guys doing with my stuff?
Beth, We’re moving you to a nursing home.
Rick," A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I’m a genius. I build robots for fun."
Jerry," Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas."
Morty," Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."
Jerry," Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
Rick, What are you trying to say about Morty? That he’s stupid or something?
Beth," Oh, don’t high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
Rick, I-I-I don’t know what you mean by that. Can-can-can you be a little bit more specific?
Jerry," Oh, for crying out- he’s got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?"
Morty, I do?
Jerry," Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you’re not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
Morty," Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that’s a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
Rick," Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
Morty," Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can’t."
Rick," The square root of pi, Morty. Go!"
Morty, 1.77245385 Whoa!
Beth, What the hell?
Jerry, Holy crap. He’s right.
Rick," Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
Morty," ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I’m so smart!"
Jerry, But-
Rick, I told the both of you school is stupid. It’s not how you learn things. Morty’s a gifted child. He has a special mind. That’s why he’s my little helper. He’s like me. He’s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He’s too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
Beth," Jerry, I don’t want whatever’s happening here to stop."
Jerry," No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
Rick," Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it’s gonna be clear communication."
Rick, No idea what you’re talking about.
Jerry," Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it’s your bedtime in an hour. Don’t stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you’ll have me, I would love to have you."
Beth, You know what? Okay.
Morty," Holy cow, Rick. I didn’t know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
Rick," Full disclosure, Morty it’s not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
Morty," Aw, man."
Rick," Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you’re gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you’re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
Morty," Ohh, man. (Losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh."
Rick," I’m sorry, Morty. It’s a bummer. In reality, you’re as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we’re gonna have to go get more"
TV, Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby.
Jerry, What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? (Sigh)
Jerry, Outside?
Jerry, Are you kidding me?! Come on!
Summer," Oh, my God."
Morty, What's wrong?
Jerry, Your idiot dog!
Morty," Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy."
Jerry," Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!"
Rick," Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."
Jerry," Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
Rick," I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty."
Jerry," Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!"
Summer, Ha-ha!
Morty," Aw, man!"
Rick," Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
Rick," All right, Ruffles What's his name?"
Morty, Snuffles.
Rick," Snuffles, shake."
Rick, Roll over.
Rick, Go to the bathroom.
Jerry, Holy crap!
Summer, No way.
Rick," Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty."
Morty," That was fantastic, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
Morty, W-w-w-what is it?
Rick," It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about."
Morty," You talking about ""Inception""?"
Rick," That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may-(Belch)-be make sense."
Morty," ""Inception"" made sense."
Rick," You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time."
Morty," Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
Rick," Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
Rick," Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me."
 Pancakes, You don't know me!
 Goldenfold,"' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice."
Commercial Announcer," Next week on ""The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"""
 Pancakes, You don't know me!
 Pancakes," Then let me get to know yo, damn it!"
Rick, Uh-oh! Spoilers!
Rick, I'm a full season behind.
Morty," Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird."
Rick," It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty."
 Pancakes, Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
 Goldenfold, I'll take two.
 Pancakes," Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
Goldenfold, You don't know me.
Rick," All right, Morty, time to make our move."
 Goldenfold, Make it bounce.
 Pancakes," No, you didn't."
 Goldenfold," Oh, jiggle it now."
 Pancakes, You better stop with that.
Rick, Allahu (Belch) akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
Rick," Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
 Goldenfold, The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
Rick," Take cover, Morty!"
 Goldenfold, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Morty, Ooohhh!
Rick," Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. (Belch) I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty."
Morty, What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
Rick," Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!"
Jerry, Now bring me my slippers.
Summer," Now, be my footstool, Snuffles."
Jerry, This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
Jerry," You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?"
Snuffles, Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
Summer," Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something. (Offscreen) That is so awesome."
Snuffles, Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
Jerry," Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna""."
Snuffles, Ooooyayawawa!
Summer," He's saying ""I love Obama"". (Offscreen) So cute! I'm posting this (Onscreen) online, like, right now."
Jerry, I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
Snuffles, Hmm?
Rick," Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
Goldenfold, Why would I negotiate with you?
Rick, Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
 Goldenfold, Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
Plane Passengers, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick," Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking."
Plane Passenger, Oh no! Run!
Plane Passengers, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Morty, Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
Morty, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Rick," Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!"
 Pancakes," Hey, you don't know me!"
Morty," Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a (Offscreen) mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!"
Rick," Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!"
 Pancakes, You don't know m-
Rick," All right, let's go."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird."
Rick," Don't judge, Morty."
Morty," Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
Rick," Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch."
M Monster," Ooh, hey!"
Morty," Ooh, oh! Oh, man."
M Monster, Come and join us.
Morty," I'm sorry. No, no."
M Monster," Ooh, come here!"
Morty," No, thanks!"
Giant Frog Woman," Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby!"
Morty," No, I'm okay."
Morty, Whoa!
Summer," Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?"
Morty, Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
Rick," Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here."
Morty," It's Summer! Aw, geez."
Summer," Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
Centaur, Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads!
Rick," Time to go another dream deep, Morty!"
Morty, What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
Rick," Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?"
Scary Terry," Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!"
Rick," Oh, here we go!"
Morty, Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
Rick, Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
Scary Terry," I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
Jerry," Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?"
Snuffles, Snuffles fix. Make better.
Summer, Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
Snuffles, Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
Jerry," Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over."
Summer," Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away."
Jerry, Why not?
Summer, I don't know. It's Indian giving.
TV," A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy."
Summer," Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
Little Girl," ""A,"" ""b"" his name is scary Terry ""C,"" ""d"" he's very scary."
Rick," Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!"
Morty," Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!"
Little Girl," ""E,"" ""f"" he'll design your death"
Rick, The little girl!
Morty, Huh?
Little Girl," ""J,"" ""k,"" he'll really ruin your day."
Rick," Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good."
Scary Terry," Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!"
Morty, Ohhhh!
Rick," Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!"
Snuffles," Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?"
Snuffles, Do not call me that!
Snuffles," ""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
Summer," Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me."
Snuffles, Scaring you?
Summer, AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Snuffles," Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?"
Summer, Uhhh ...
Jerry," Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?"
Snuffles," Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?"
Summer, Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
Snuffles, You will walk when it is time to walk.
Rick, What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
Morty," We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
Rick," Oh, yeah."
Scary Terry," Buckle up, bitch!"
Morty, Ooooooaaahhh!
Morty," Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!"
Scary Terry," You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
Rick," Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
Morty, But that's the opposite of what-
Rick," Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
Morty," Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."
Rick, Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
Morty," Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking."
Rick," Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
Scary Terry, You can run But you can't hide! (Yawn)
Rick," Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move."
Jerry," Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding."
Summer," Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
Jerry," Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous."
Snuffles," You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
Jerry, Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
Scary Melissa," Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day?"
Scary Terry, I don't want to talk about it!
Scary Terry," Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
Scary Melissa," I love you, too, Terry."
Rick," Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
Rick, Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Morty," Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry."
Scary Terry," Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!"
Monster Teacher," Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?"
Scary Terry," Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
Monster Teacher," Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Morty: Hey, leave him alone!"
Rick," Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
Monster Teacher," Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this."
Rick," You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
Morty," Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool."
Scary Terry," Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say."
Morty," You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
Rick," You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip."
Scary Terry," Oh, hey, it's you guys!"
Scary Melissa, I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.
Scary Terry," If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
Rick," As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
Little Girl,"' ""Q,"" ""r,"" you won't get very far."
Scary Terry, I always hated that song!
Scary Terry," These halves don't belong together, bitch!"
Scary Terry, Sex is sacred!
Scary Terry," This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!"
 Goldenfold," Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought."
Morty, What the hell?
Rick," Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?"
Morty," Oh, man, what's going on?"
Rick," Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
Jerry, I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
Summer, This is why I choose to get C's.
Rick," Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
Morty,"- Dad! - Rick! - Oh, thank God, Morty."
Rick, If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
Jerry," Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it."
Rick," It's all over, Jerry."
Jerry," Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. (Jerry pees on a pile of guns) See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them."
Snuffles, Bad person. Bad.
Rick," Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
Snuffles," Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side."
Morty," Th-thanks, snuffles."
Snuffles, Begin phase two.
Reporter, Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. (Two dogs come into the news room with a muzzle)
Bill," I think she's saying, ""I love lasagna."
Morty," Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!"
Rick," No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon."
Morty, What?
Rick," It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream."
Morty, But I-it's been like a whole year!
Rick," It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
Morty," Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
Rick," No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
Morty," Aw, man, geez! Seriously?"
Rick," Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
Morty," Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
Rick, Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
Morty, What?!
Rick," It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg."
 Dog," It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation."
Snuffles, Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
Accountant Dog," Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom."
Snuffles," To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness."
Accountant Dog, Do you think they would have done this for us?
Snuffles, We are not them! We are not them. (Snuffles wakes up from the dream) Assemble the troops. I've made a decision.
Snuffles," Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory."
Morty," I'm gonna miss you, snowball."
Snuffles," You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much."
Beth, Jerry?
Jerry," I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller."
Beth," Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
Morty," Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick."
Rick," I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven."
Morty," You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick."
Rick," What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
Scary Glenn," Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill."
Rick," Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch. (Terry and Rick are getting stoned)"
Jerry, *singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!
Jerry," *singing* In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham."
Jerry," Um, Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?"
Beth, Alive? For your parents?
Jerry, Good one.
Beth, Hey man!
Jerry, You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.
Morty," *not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something."
Jerry," Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now."
Morty, *hands over his tablet* Ohhhh…
Summer," Dad, I’m not giving you my phone."
Jerry," Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I’m joining Facebook."
Rick," *offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody."
Jerry, More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
Rick," Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend."
Ruben, Pearl Harbor.
Rick, I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.
Beth," Aw, Dad… That is so sweet."
Jerry," *squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don’t get it."
Ruben, Korea.
Rick," Don’t worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I’ll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise."
Jerry," Huh. You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there’s my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!"
Leonard," Merry Christmas, son."
Jerry," Oh, hi. Can I help you?"
Joyce," Jerry, this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn’t you get our text message?"
 and Morty, No.
Jacob, You must be Jerry! That’s a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?
Jerry, *smiling uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you’re a…friend of the family…?
Leonard," *puts an arm around Jacob’s shoulders* The way we see it, he’s a part of the family."
Jerry, Wow!
Joyce," After your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?"
Beth," Holy crap, Joyce. That’s amazing."
Leonard, Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.
Jacob, All three of us.
Jerry, …Cool… Eggnog?
Jacob," Now we are talkin’! This man’s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?"
Rick," Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there."
Jacob," Merry Christmas, man."
Rick, Morty! A moment of your time?
Rick," He’s in bad shape, Morty."
Morty," Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?"
Rick," Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I’m sittin’ here trying to save the guy’s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He’ll know what’s goin’ on."
Morty, *extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
Rick, In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head*
Morty, Ruben… Minnesota?
Rick," Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don’t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse."
Morty, W-What proc—
Beth," Hey Dad, where's Morty?"
Rick, He's busy.
Morty, Rick… Where am I?
Rick," *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance."
Rick," Welcome, Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty gasps.) …to Anatomy Park!"
Rick," It’s a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn’t cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead."
Morty, Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
Rick," You got a problem with that last one, Morty?"
Morty," Huh? No, no, I’m just reading them out loud in the order I’m seeing them."
Rick," Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby."
Rick," I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I’m still a little defensive. Let’s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I’m picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty."
Rick, Proceed to the liver.
Automated voice, Arriving at ‘Liver’.
Morty, *stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!
Automated voice, Mind the gap.
Morty," It’s really scary in here, Rick."
Rick," Liver’s under maintenance. Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. Don’t judge. You don’t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great."
Morty," OOOOHHH! Rick, it’s a monster!"
Rick," No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf."
Poncho, Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
Morty, Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
 Bloom, Poncho! That’s quite enough.
 Bloom," Morty, that’s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is Roger and Annie."
Morty, *staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh…
 Bloom, And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
Rick," Hey Bloom, it’s Rick. What the hell’s goin’ on here?"
 Bloom," I don’t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I’m afraid the exhibits are unlocked."
Morty, Exhibits?
 Bloom," Anatomy Park’s greatest attraction, young man, isn’t the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas."
Rick, Watch it.
 Bloom, It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity’s most noble and ferocious diseases.
Morty, Diseases?!
Poncho," Hey Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living museum is officially a wild safari!"
Roger, Hepatitis A! Run!
Jacob," Oh… *leans over and wipes some food from Joyce’s mouth with a napkin* The food goes in your mouth, girl!"
Jerry," Aha… I’m sorry Jacob, I guess I’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?"
Joyce," We can go into detail later, son."
Leonard," Now wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. Let’s all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry’s smile becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment."
Jerry," Dad, please, what are you saying?"
Beth," Whatever it is, it’s beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you."
Jerry," Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say Jacob is your lover."
Leonard," No no no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother’s lover. (Jerry again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman."
Jacob, Oh… *reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*
Jacob," Jerry, this ham’s got to be all you, right? It’s in-cred-i-ble."
Summer," *smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad."
Poncho, AHHHHHH!
 Bloom, Hepatitis won’t follow us into the respiratory system!
Roger, That’s strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.
 Bloom, So the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. That’s why security is offline.
Morty," W-Well, I guess we better check it out."
Alexander," Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*"
 Bloom, *points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!
Roger," If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage."
Morty, *raises his hand* I’ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh…
Poncho," Don’t be a hero, kid."
Morty, I’m not. I’m doin’ it because it’s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*
Poncho, *cocks his gun* We shouldn’t be here.
 Bloom," Whatever you do, don’t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life’s work."
Annie, Ah!
 Bloom," It’s alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!"
Morty, Whoa! *grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!
Morty, Oh! What are those things?!
 Bloom," Tuberculosis, coming in fast!"
Poncho, *raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!
 Bloom, *grabs Poncho’s arm* No! Do you know what you’ve done?!
 Bloom, Get to the digestive tract! He’s coughing!
Alexander, Waaaah! Don’t let me die!
Rick," Just take a deep breath, Ruben."
Morty, You’re not gonna die! What’s your name?
Alexander, My name is… *his hand slips from Morty’s and he’s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!
Morty, Rick! Ruben’s got tuberculosis!
Rick," Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I’ll just cure it, and then—"
Rick," Okay. Well I can’t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You’re trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—"
Rick," —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I’m biased, but, I think it’s great, Morty."
Rick," *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don’t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I’m just saying, if that becomes impossible—"
Rick," —please, you gotta treat yourself."
Morty," Geez, what’s that horrible smell?"
 Bloom," You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I’m kidding. (As he speaks, Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed."
Morty," Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!"
 Bloom, The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There’s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
Morty, Everybody! Get to the colon!
Poncho, Now I’m takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
 Bloom, Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
Roger, Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.
Morty," Hey, just so you know, I-I’m actually fourteen. So, you know…"
Annie, What?
Morty, Not twelve.
Annie, Okay.
Morty, Because he just said I was twelve.
Annie, Oh. Good for you.
Morty, *slumps forward* Nnn…
Animatronics," *singing* It’s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It’s a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It’s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It’s a small, small intestine!"
Roger, It goes on like this for miles…
 Bloom, *excitedly* And then we get to the large intestine!
Poncho, Shh. *shines flashlight* I hear something.
 Bloom, *whispers* Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move.
 Bloom, Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
Annie, We’re sitting ducks!
Morty, Doc! Didn’t you say the body was filling up with gas?
 Bloom, Yes. Why?
Poncho, Kid! You’re a genius! *pulls out a match*
 Bloom, Are you mad?!
Morty, *grabs Annie’s hand* Everybody! In here!
Poncho, Hey Gonorrhea! How’s this for a burning sensation?
Summer," *singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!"
Leonard," Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha."
Summer, Christmas drums being played by a boy!
Beth," Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted."
Jerry," I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I’m being punished for taking your iPad."
Beth," What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I’m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let’s just be here."
Ethan, Ugh… Summer!
Summer," *stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?"
Ethan, I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
Summer, I don’t have my phone! I’m doing a human holiday!
Ethan, Did you even consider how that might make me feel?
Summer, How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
Jerry," *stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?"
Ethan," Yeah, do you, Summer?"
Summer," I don’t know Ethan, do I?"
Jacob," *stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer’s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man."
Roger," I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we’ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben’s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery."
Poncho, What the hell is that?
 Bloom," The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load."
Roger," Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!"
Morty, Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
 Bloom," That’s bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?"
Poncho, Everybody get back!
 Bloom," Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?"
Poncho," *laughs* That’s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I’ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—"
Morty, AHHHHH!!!
Poncho, Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!
Annie, You guys!
Roger," It’s gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck!"
Annie, No!
Roger," This is okay! It’s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you can—"
Annie, No!
Jacob," Let me ask you something Ethan. Where’s the anger coming from, man?"
Ethan, From Summer being a total bitch!
Jacob, Where’s the anger coming from?
Ethan, …My brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can’t… I can’t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I’m… m-made me a girl!
Jacob," He didn’t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to her. Brand new."
Ethan, Come here right now!
Summer," Oh my god, I’m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!"
Ethan, I love you so much.
Jerry, Um…
Joyce," You did it again, cubby. Come here."
Jerry, No! Stop! I hate this!
Joyce," Well, Christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son."
Jerry," Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame."
Animatronic Ruben," My name’s Ruben Ridley. You’re inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I’ll be inside all of you."
Animatronic Ruben, My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.
Annie, *whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want…
Rick, I’m trying to concentrate.
Jerry," Ah, Rick?"
Rick," *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry."
Jerry," *enters anyway* I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben’s corpse* Right now, you’re my sanest relative."
Rick," Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?"
Morty," Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick."
Morty, We need to get to the left nipple!
 Bloom," The body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the ‘ceiling’.) The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It’s connected to the skeletal system. That’s why we call it the Bone Train. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?"
Annie, If it’ll get us out of here.
 Bloom," How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?"
Morty, Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let’s go.
Jerry," Well, I can see that you’re busy… Merry Christmas, Rick."
 Anatomy Park, the Bone Train]
 Bloom, There’s no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
Morty," …Uh, well…"
 Bloom," No, you’re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on."
Annie, *points* What the hell is that?
 Bloom, E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
 Bloom," Oh wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!"
Annie, They’re chewing through the doors!
Morty," Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!"
Rick," I’m almost there, Morty!"
Reporter, Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
Tom," Well, his eyes aren’t twinkling, and his dimples aren’t merry, but I’m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!"
Reporter," Thank you, Tom. Let’s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles."
Eric," We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man’s size! And you know what they say about that!"
Reporter," Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains."
Morty," Oh my god, the track!"
Annie, It’s Hepatitis A!
Annie, The nipple hole…
Morty, It’s beautiful…
Annie, Aw no!
Annie, Whoa! It’s Hepatitis C!
Morty, Um… We… Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
Annie, I… think they’re just like that? I think they’re just good guys.
Morty, Oh. Huh.
Rick, Where’s Dr. Bloom?
Morty, Sorry Rick… He’s dead…
Rick," Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!"
Beth, Jerry doesn’t know what he’s missing.
Jacob," He’ll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together."
Beth," I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don’t know if our marriage will—"
Summer, It’s raining blood!
Jacob," Oh, shit. find Jerry!"
Beth, Oh god.
Beth, Jerry!
Jerry, *stands and hugs her* It’s alright! The TV says there’s nothing to worry about.
Summer," Dad, can I have my phone back?"
Jerry," Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It’ll help you relax."
Jacob, This is nice.
Jerry," Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob."
Summer," No we didn’t, Dad. No we didn’t."
Rick," Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park."
Annie," Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom’s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!"
Rick, What about Pirates of the Pancreas…?
Annie, I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
Rick, Booyah! Hold your breath!
Morty," Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina."
Morty, W-What’s wrong with that? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
Rick," C’mon. Let’s get some stuffing, I’m starving."
Rick," Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?"
Rick," Loud and clear, Annie."
Annie," Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—"
Alejandro, Hey Rick.
Annie," Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media."
Rick, Hey everybody.
All," Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin'. (etc.)"
Annie, So. Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick," Yeah, talk to me."
Alejandro," Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” (Rick begins to look agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—"
Ethan," So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?"
Rick," Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They’re inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan."
Ethan, … Cool. And who pays me?
in, Rick and Morty Transcripts
Rick, T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
Morty," Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?"
Rick," Oh, yes, Morty. It’s almost unbelievable, isn’t it?"
Morty," Yeah, you know? There’s something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is."
Rick," Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing."
Morty, Wh… convincing?
Rick," Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!"
Morty," Uhh, okay."
Beth," *robotic* I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. (Beth drives away.)"
Morty, What’s with Mom?
Rick," Oh, what’s with Mom? So, you’re saying that she’s acting weird? How soph-*burp*-isticated. Careful, guys. You’re gonna burn out the CPU with this one."
Morty," Okay, you know what, Rick? You’re acting weird, too."
Rick," Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”"
Morty," Alright, well I’ll see you after school. (Walks into the side of the garage.) Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I’m all right. I’m okay."
 Goldenfold," Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? (Students whisper.) Morty?"
Morty," Uh, me?"
 Goldenfold, What is 5 x 9?
Morty," Um, you know, it’s, uh, at least 40."
 Goldenfold," Morty, that’s exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here."
Jessica," Whoo! Way to go, Morty!"
 Goldenfold," Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!"
Rick, *spying from outside* Interesting…
Morty, W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?
Student," Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?"
 Goldenfold," Oh, that’s a good question."
Morty, Concentrated huh?
 Goldenfold," Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?"
Morty, Uhhh…
Jessica," Come on, Morty. Isn’t your grandpa, like, a scientist?"
Morty," Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn’t go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff."
Jessica," I bet you’ve seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend."
Morty," Uh, y-you will?"
 Goldenfold," Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty."
Rick," *kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There’s a family emergency."
 Goldenfold," Stop right there! If he leaves, I’m giving him an F!"
Rick, He doesn’t care.
Morty," Aw, man! (Rick drags him to the locker room.) Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!"
Rick," Take a shower with me, Morty."
Morty, What?!
Rick," Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty."
Morty," Ugh! I’m gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*"
Rick," Morty, that’s not class. T-t-t-that wasn’t your teacher. This isn’t your school. This entire world is not the world. We’re inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship."
Morty, Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?
Rick," It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn’t say so until we got in the shower. They won’t monitor us in here."
Morty, Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!
Rick," Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy’s most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it’s lucky for us they’re also really uncomfortable with nudity."
Morty," Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica."
Rick," I can’t let you do that, Morty."
Morty, Give it to me!
Rick, No! You give it to me!
Morty, G-g-give it!
Rick," Morty, come on! Morty!"
Morty," No, Rick!"
Prince Nebulon," Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they’re not!"
Kevin, What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?
Stu," Uh, sir, we have a situation over here."
Prince Nebulon," If there’s a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu."
Stu," Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. (Jerry appears on a large screen.) There’s another real human in the simulator."
Jerry," Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this."
Prince Nebulon, How did this happen?! Where’s the Abductions Department?
Kevin," Well, Simulations doesn’t simulate anybody that’s been abducted, so—"
Prince Nebulon," Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one’s fault. Oh, okay. I’m sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There’s still another human in here! Who is he?"
Stu," Rick’s son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn’t noticed he’s in a simulation."
Prince Nebulon," *sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we’ll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target."
Jerry, *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It’s just a pitch. Gotta relax.
Radio," This is earth radio. And now, here’s…human music."
Jerry, Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*
Morty, Rick!
Rick," Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It’s the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You’d have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy’s putting a bun between two hot dogs."
Morty," I don’t know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before."
Rick," Well, look at that old lady. She’s, she’s walking a cat on a leash."
Morty," Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick."
Rick," Look, I-I-I don’t wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She’s an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?"
Morty," Okay, okay, you got me on that one."
Rick," Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven’t seen that somewhere in real life before?"
Morty," No, no. I haven’t seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?"
Rick," You’re missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No."
Morty," So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?"
Rick," Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you’d been paying attention."
Paramedic," We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he’ll die!"
Morty, Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.
Rick," Yeah, it’s a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they’re gonna pay!"
Morty," Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?"
Rick," We’ll scam the scammers, Morty. And we’re gonna take them for everything they’ve got."
Jerry, National Apple Farmers of America…
Jerry," Welcome to our ad agency. I’m Jerry Smith. (Audience stares blankly.) Alright. I’ll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we’re hungry. (Audience stares blankly.) With that, I give you your new slogan! (Flips paper to reveal sign saying “Hungry for Apples?” Audience continues staring.) Well, say something! Do you like it?"
 Marklevitz, Yes.
Jerry, You do?
All, Yes.
Jerry, So I sold it? I sold the idea?
All, Yes.
Jerry, Oh my god! Thank you!
All, *shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You’re welcome.
Jerry, Hey! I just sold my first pitch!
Old man, Slow down!
Woman, Lookin’ good.
Mailman, My man!
Simulation Beth, (at Simulation Smith house) *answers phone* Hello.
Jerry, Guess who just sold the apples campaign.
Simulation Beth, Who just sold the apples campaign?
Jerry," Me! I guess it wasn’t a rip-off of ""got milk?"" after all. Guess someone was wrong."
Simulation Beth, Yes.
Jerry," Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife."
Simulation Beth, Okay.
Jerry," Wait, really?"
Simulation Beth, Yes.
Jerry," Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I’m going to make love to my wife!"
Woman, Lookin’ good.
Old man, Slow down!
Mailman, My man! *glitches into a tree*
Morty," Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don’t know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous."
Rick," Morty, relax. It’s just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You’re gonna be fine. (Lowers Morty’s pants slightly and puts a hat on him.) Just follow my lead. (Rick and Morty fist bump.) Yo, deejay, drop that beat."
Rick," Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don’t think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny."
Morty," You got that right, Rick."
Rick," Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah! (Crowd cheers.) All the ladies say, ""yeah!"" (Ladies cheer.) Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! (People start glitching.)"
Jerry," *kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don’t move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!"
Rick," Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn’t Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten! (Simulation freezes. Rick and Morty jump offstage.) Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!"
Jerry, Yeah! You like that? Now who’s unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!
Jerry," Oh, my god. That’s the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. It’s… it’s too good. I don’t deserve this, Beth. I’m a fraud."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?"
Rick," Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it’s frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*"
Morty, Holy crap!
Rick," Come on, Morty."
Morty, *jumps off edge*
Zigerion," Sir, they’re over the edge."
Prince Nebulon," Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!"
Rick," Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That’s how we’re gonna scam these idiots."
Morty," So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you’re so much smarter than them?"
Rick," It’s an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I’m one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren’t good at much, but they’re really good at making these chips."
Morty," I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one."
Rick," Don’t worry about it, Morty. There’s plenty of them, you little goofball. (Both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!"
Morty," Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!"
Rick," Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella."
Morty, Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.
Rick," Totes malotes, dawg."
Morty," Just kind of hard to believe, you know?"
Rick," Believe it, Morty. And once again, I’m flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine."
Jerry," Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?"
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry," Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let’s face it. ""Hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""Got milk?"" It’s almost identical."
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry," Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I’ll just pack up my desk."
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry," *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don’t have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There’s not even a single word in ""Hungry for Apples"" that’s shared by ""Got milk?"" It’s a completely different slogan. It’s different! And I shouldn’t be fired. I should be promoted!"
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry, Yeah! Wait. Really?
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry," Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it’s the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time."
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry," I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something."
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry, Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry, Could we nominate me?
 Marklevitz, *snaps fingers* Yes.
Jerry, Holy crap!
Rick," Get in, Morty. I’m gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (Keypad beeps.) Huh. I thought I entered the code right. (Keypad beeps.)"
Prince Nebulon," Well, what’s this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you’re inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You’re still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!"
Cynthia," Sir, the, uh, doctor’s appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—"
Prince Nebulon," Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific."
Rick, Uhh…
Prince Nebulon," We’ve known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!"
Rick," Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!"
Prince Nebulon, That is why you’re never getting home. Get them!
Rick, RUN MORTY!
Morty, Oh my god!
Jerry," I got to tell you, this morning, I didn’t even know this award existed. Now I’m holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it’s, it’s more meaningful than that."
Mailman, My man!
Jerry," Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!"
Mailmen, My my my my man!
Jerry, Aah! What the hell?! (Appley award glitches out of existence.) No.
Rick, Jerry?!
Morty, Dad!
Rick, What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don’t have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*
Jerry, *sobbing* No!
Rick," Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers."
Morty," Oh, man! They’re hot on our tail, Rick!"
Rick, I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.
Morty," Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?"
Rick," Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water."
Morty," Whoa! It’s all here, Rick!"
Rick," Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium."
Morty, Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.
Rick," Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There’s no time!"
Morty, *freezes up*
Rick," Oh, no."
Jerry, What the…?
Rick, No!
Prince Nebulon," *laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You’re inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!"
Rick, You simulated my grandson’s genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
Kevin," You said you weren’t gonna tell anyone! I’m never gonna live this down, am I?"
Rick," All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?"
Prince Nebulon," Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I’m done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He’s trying to figure out if He’s in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You’re not. *walks back* Or are you? (Rick and Jerry leave.) *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don’t have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation."
Cynthia," Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?"
Prince Nebulon," *loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can."
Rick," Hey, Jerry, don’t worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?"
Jerry," You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you’re one of us."
Rick," Maybe you’re right, Jerry. Maybe you’re right."
Prince Nebulon," All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn’t ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient…"
Jerry, Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?
Rick," Why don’t you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can’t. They blew up."
Jerry, So… What do you think?
 Marklevitz, You’re fired.
Jerry, Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.
 Marklevitz," Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out."
 Marklevitz," Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?"
Rick," Hey, Morty."
Morty, What?
Rick," Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?"
Morty," Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?"
Rick," Y-y-you’re a good kid, Morty. Y-you’re a real l-little c-character, Morty."
Morty," Oh, boy."
Rick," You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You’re my little friend, aren’t you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You’re a real true hero out in the field. You’re a... You’re a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?"
Morty," Have you been drinking, Rick?"
Rick," I really appreciate you, Morty."
Morty," O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick"
Rick," *suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty’s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!"
Morty, No! No! No!
Rick, You little son of a bitch!
Morty," *terrified, gasps*"
Rick," I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you’re a good… You’re a good kid, Morty."
Morty, Geez!
Rick, Y-you’re a good… You’re a good kid. *passes out*
Morty, Oh my god!
Rick, *snores*
Morty, W-w-what the hell? What a life.

Rick, Run!
 and Summer, *incoherent zombie noises*
Rick," Morty, do it! Hit the button now!"
Morty," I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!"
Rick," *holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!"
Beth," Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart."
Morty, Ohhhh…
Rick," Good work, Morty."
Rick," *holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!"
Rick," You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna."
Morty, I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were!
Rick," I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough."
Morty," Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!"
Rick," Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty’s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!"
Morty, *pushes Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!
Rick," Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how simple and fun it is."
Morty, *suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?
Rick," Okay, fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month."
Morty," Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!"
Rick, Every 10th.
Morty," Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going."
Beth," Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again."
Rick, Washing dishes?
Beth, No. The opposite. Can you fix it?
Summer," Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?"
Rick, Yeah just don't do it.
Summer, Grandpa!
Jerry," Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?"
Rick," Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family."
Morty," Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk."
Rick," Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this."
Meeseeks, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
Rick," You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar."
Meeseeks," Yes, siree!"
Rick, The Meeseeks fulfills the request.
Meeseeks, All done!
Jerry, [amazed] Wow!
Rick, And then it stops existing.
Summer," Oh, my God, he exploded!"
Rick," Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods."
Morty, All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!
Beth, So many possibilities.
Summer, My mind is racing.
Jerry," If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple."
Meeseeks, I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Summer, I want to be popular at school!
Meeseeks," Ooh, okay!"
Jerry," Summer, what did I just-"
Beth, I want I want to be a more complete woman!
Jerry, Beth!
Jerry," You guys are doing it wrong. He said ""simple."""
Jerry," Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game."
Jerry, Nailed it.
Rick," God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?"
Morty," Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?"
Rick, Can't wait.
Morty, Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!
Rick," Oh, my God, so embarrassing."
Morty," You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!"
Rick, Yeah. Beginner's luck.
Beth," I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...-(Meeseeks 2 stares attentively)- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon."
Beth," Well, her waistline isn't."
Beth, You're saying I should leave Jerry. (Beth starts to cry) I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.
Beth, I think I've had enough.
Jerry," Yeah, yeah. I got it."
Jerry," Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?"
Jerry," You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up."
Jerry," Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck."
Rick," All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?"
Morty," Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously."
Morty," Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar."
Giant, Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!
Rick," Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word."
Morty," No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it."
Giant, I smell the blood of- whoop!(the giant falls and cracks his head open on the table corner before hitting the ground)
Morty, Holy crap.
Rick," Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out."
Giant woman," Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!"
Detective," Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, ""hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"""
Morty, Th-th but that's not how it went down!
Detective," Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that."
Rick," Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun."
Summer," Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you."
Beth, The most important love you can receive is from yourself.
Meeseek," Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!"
Jerry," Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!"
Meeseek," Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you."
Jerry, Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!
Meeseek, Just try to relax.
Jerry," You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! (Jerry walks to the dinning room) Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through."
Beth," Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry."
Jerry, You're kidding me.
Beth, Notice anything different?
Jerry, I'm sorry. Hours?
Summer," Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!"
Meeseek," Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird."
Judge," Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty."
Morty," We're gonna be okay, Rick."
Rick," How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-(the court doors burst open and a giant in a suit walks down the isle.)"
Giant Lawyer," Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home."
Rick, W-what the hell is he talking about?
Giant Lawyer," They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever."
Morty," Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!"
Rick," All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?"
Morty," Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers."
Rick," Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash."
Morty," Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps."
Rick," Oh, boy, Morty."
Morty," Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure."
Rick," What do you say, Morty?"
Morty," I say give me a hand, sidekick."
NOTE, to make this easier an * will be put next to meeseek everytime a different meeseeks talks.
Jerry, Everybody shut up! Let me try! (Jerry swings and misses again) Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Beth, I'm going out.
Jerry, Wait. What?
Beth," Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?"
Jerry," Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner."
All the Meeseeks, AWWWWWWW!
Jerry," Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine."
Meeseek, I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!
Rick," Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps."
Morty," All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. (They see an opening in one of the steps) Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step."
Morty," Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun."
Rick," What are you looking at, mother-"
Morty," Easy, Rick."
Waitress," Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies."
Rick," Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?"
Morty," Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?"
Slippery, Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.
Rick, 25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?
Waitress, That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.
 Booby Buyer," Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels."
Waitess," It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline."
 Booby Buyer, Rats! What a shame.
Rick," Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out."
Morty," You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?"
Rick," Uh, because it's lame?"
Morty," It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!"
Rick, Whatever.
Meeseek," It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks."
Meeseeks," Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through!"
New Meeseek, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
Meeseek, Kill him!
New Meeseek, Hisssss! (He attacks another meeseek)
 Jelly Bean, How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean!
Morty," Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure."
 Jelly Bean, Nice. Is it a fun adventure?
Morty, I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.
 Jelly Bean," Well, isn't that what adventures do?"
Morty," Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow."
 Jelly Bean, Yeah. (He rubs Morty's sholders)
Morty, Okay. Uh. B-bye.
 Jelly Bean," Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!"
Morty, Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.
Morty, Get off of me!
Rick, ♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪
Morty, Whoo! No! Stop! Please!
 Jelly Bean," Stop being such a tease, you sweet little-"
Morty, No! No!
Meeseek," Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done."
Meeseek," No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game."
All other Meeseeks, Where's he going with this? What's he mean?
Meeseek, When we kill him!
Beth," Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about."
Jerry, Where would you go?
Beth," I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina."
Jerry, Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?
Jerry, What the heck?
Meeseek, There he is!
Beth," Run, Jerry!"
Meeseek," Come on out, Jerry!"
Jerry," Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?"
Meeseek," Oh, we're well past that, Jerry."
Card Player," Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?"
Rick," Read 'em and weep, fellas! (Morty comes back) Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad."
Rick," We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!"
Morty," Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home."
Rick," Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?"
Morty, Really?
Rick," Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending."
Slippery, Buckle up! (He starts to take them down)
Woman," Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!"
Jerry, Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?
Beth," Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you."
All Meeseeks, He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!
Meeseeks, Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?
Samantha," Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!"
Meeseek," Ooh, nice! (Stops existing)"
Jerry, I think we'll take our food to go.
Owner," No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer."
Jerry, Fair enough.
The First Villager," Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!"
Rick," Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet."
Morty," Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place."
Rick," Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style."
The First Villager," Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally."
Morty," Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry."
Jerry, So... You still thinking about taking that trip?
Beth," Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to ""complete their task."""
Jerry, Was I one of those guys?
Beth, The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.
Jerry, Well... I got you pregnant.
Beth, Yeah...
Rick, What the hell happened to this place?
Beth," Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible."
Rick," Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot."
Beth, Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?
Rick," Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box."
Jerry, No. No more boxes.
Rick," What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs! (Everyone laughs) Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody."
Beth, I don't get it.

Principal Vagina," (over the intercom, while the students talk) Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover."
s friend, (to Jessica) Hey.
Morty," Ohhh. Okay, here we go. * walks over to Jessica and her friends* (Nervously) H-Heyy Jessica, ughh."
Jessica, What's up Morty? *sneezes*
Morty, Ugghh
Brad, *butts in* What are you doing?
Morty, Ummm
Brad," Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?"
Morty," Well, I mean, I was thinking about it."
Brad," Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!"
Jessica," (sarcastically) Gee, thanks, Brad."
Brad," I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager."
Jerry," Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape."
Morty," (Plays with a cookie in sadness) You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!"
Jerry," Ahhh, well, (gets another jar of sauce out of the cupboard) I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
Rick," (enters and interrupts Jerry) I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me. (grabs a glass from a cupboard)"
Jerry," I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. (points to Morty)"
Rick," (grabs ice from out of the freezer)(sarcastically) Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. (gets juice out of the refrigerator) I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread."
Jerry," (Angrily) My marriage is fine, thank you."
Rick," Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is, (pours juice into the glass) but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed."
Morty," Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that."
Rick," Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. (exits room, drinking juice)"
Morty," (In woe) Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. (exits kitchen)"
Jerry," Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom. (exits opposite direction)"
Rick," (With his back to Morty) Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? *Morty closes door* I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great."
Morty," Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? (walks to Rick at his desk) Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"
Rick," Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. (points to the shelf)"
Morty," (Angrily) YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick. (Rick gets up and grabs a box of supplies from the shelf) I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?"
Rick," *sighs* You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass! (grabs some test tubes with yellow liquid and holds one up) Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?"
Rick," It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain, (sets down the box of objects, opens a hatch in a machine, and pours the oxytocin in) ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta *burps* combine it with some of your DNA."
Morty," Oh well, okay... (zips down his fly)"
Rick," A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones. (plucks hair from Morty's head)"
Morty, Oww!
Rick," (grabs the flask containing the orange liquid) Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?"
Morty," Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick! (walks to the door, but thinks about it and looks back) Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?"
Rick," Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof."
Rick," Ugh, unless she has the flu. (shrugs it off)"
Jerry," Beth, do you still love me?"
Beth, *sighs* Want kinda question is that?
Jerry," The ""yes"" or ""no"" kind. *weak laugh of obviousness*"
Beth," Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?"
Jerry, Yess.
Beth, Are you gonna build them?
Jerry, Noo.
Beth," Then what good was the ""yes""?"
Jerry," (walks to Beth at the computer)(confused) Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?"
Beth," (Turns around to Jerry)(Irritated) Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?"
Jerry, Sort of.
Beth," But I obviously sort of love you, don't I? *alert on Beth's phone* So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more. (looks at her phone) Crap, They need me at the horse hospital."
Jerry, This late?
Beth," (puts on her jacket) The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone. (leaves the room, leaving Jerry alone)"
Jerry," (In his head)(Progressively angrier) *Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin*"
 MC Haps," (Background) Flu. Yo, you gotta be aware. Aware about the flu, up in the air. Imma get me a shot and make the flu go away. Flu hatin' rappers just rappin' away. Yo. Yo. Flu hatin' rapper. It's a flu hatin' rap....This is about flu awareness. Gotta be aware of the flu in the airness. Yo, I'm a flu hatin' rapper. My name is MC Haaaaaaaaaaps- Haps Yeah, I'm MC Haps, I'm a flu hatin' rapper, yo......"
Morty," Hey there, Jessica. (Pretends to trip, wiping the potion on Jessica's arm) Whooa-whoopsie!"
Jessica,"(infected) Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight."
Morty," WOW, thanks!"
Jessica,"(infected) I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!"
Morty," Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! (Brad walks passed with a drink, he overhears)"
Brad," (outraged) *spits* Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?(shoves Morty)"
Jessica," (Infected) LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK! (pulls Morty away) I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE! *sneezes*"
Brad," (infected) Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry."
Morty," Oh, well, no problem Brad."
Brad," (hugs Morty)(infected) There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special. (squeezes Morty's butt and back)"
Morty," (pushes Brad away) Whoa, take it easy!"
Jessica, (grabs Morty's left arm)(infected) GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
Brad, (grabs Morty's right arm)(infected) BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!
Principal Vagina," (Stops the fight, pulling Brad back, aided with Mr. Goldenfold) That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm."
Brad," (disappointment)(infected) Oh, Principal Vagina."
Jessica," (infected) Never leave me, Morty, NEVER."
Morty," (confused) Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?"
Jessica, (infected) Who cares? Just hold me.
Brad," (infected) LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY! *sneeze, sneeze* (exits the gym)"
Jerry, She’s gonna be alone with that guy all night.
Summer," Yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses. It’s not a very romantic setting."
Rick," Well, Summer, there’s always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up."
Summer," Grandpa, so gross! You’re talking about my mom."
Rick," Well, she’s my daughter, Summer."
Jerry, She’s not responding to my texts!
Summer," Careful, dad."
Jerry," Well, isn’t that convenient?"
Rick," Not for the men they cheat on, no."
Jerry," Okay, I’m… going to go out… for some ice cream. And maybe stop by the hospital… to support my wife… with my confidence."
Summer," God, grandpa, you’re such a dick."
Rick," I’m sorry, Summer. Your opinion means very little to me. How come you’re not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?"
Summer, Screw that. I don’t want to get sick. It’s flu season.
Rick, It is?
Summer, Yeah.
Rick, Uh-oh.
Morty, Please just let this work out.
Morty, Um… can we maybe go somewhere more private?
Morty," Oh, crap."
Rick," Morty, come on!"
Morty, [wails] are you okay?
Morty, I’m fine!
Rick," I didn’t realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty."
Morty," What the hell is going on, Rick?"
Rick," What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus. It’s gone airborne, Morty."
Morty," Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?"
Rick," It’s gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up and antidote. It’s based on praying-mantis dna. You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty."
Rick," Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty."
Jerry, [gasps]
Jerry, Nobody’s killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
Summer, [groans] Come on.
Summer, What the hell?
Summer, [screams]
Morty," Oh, my god, Rick."
Rick," Yeah, it’s pretty wild how fast that spread."
Morty, Outdone yourself?!
Rick," Yeah, I don’t know what I was thinking."
Morty," I don’t that doesn’t make any sense, Rick."
Morty," What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?"
Beth," Yes, it’s satisfying work."
Beth," Hmm, uh, what are you doing?"
Beth," Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I’d better get going."
Beth," What is it, davin?"
Beth, What?!
Beth," Let go of me, davin!"
Jerry, [grunts] You’re not Morty.
Jerry, No.
Jerry," [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you."
Beth, Jerry! Thank god!
Jerry, God?
Beth," Thank you, Jerry."
Rick," Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it’s all back to normal."
Morty, Just do it already.
Rick," Well, technically, Morty, there’s no rush."
Morty," That’s it, Rick!"
Rick," W-what do we have here, Morty?"
Morty," Oh, Rick, something’s not right."
Rick," [sighs] Yeah, you."
Morty," No, no!"
Rick," Bet you’re loving this, Morty."
Jerry, Hold on.
Beth, [whimpers]
Jerry, I wish that shotgun was my pen1s.
Beth," If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway."
Jerry," I don’t get it, and I don’t need to."
Summer, Mom! Dad!
Both, Summer!
Beth, [sighs]
Jerry, Where’s Morty?
Summer, I don’t know.
Jerry," It’s not fair to assume that, Summer."
Beth," Oh, not fair?"
Summer, Tchoo.
Rick," Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn’t i?"
Morty," Oh, my god!"
Rick, Me irresponsible?!
Morty," All right, fine."
Morty," All right, all right, Morty."
Morty," Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time."
Rick," Come on, Morty."
Morty," Sure thing, Rick."
Rick," All right, Morty."
Morty," Oh, my god, Rick!"
Rick," Calm down, Morty!"
Morty," No, I can’t deal with this!"
Rick," Calm yourself, Morty."
Morty," I can’t deal with this, Rick!"
Rick," Calm down, Morty."
Morty, This can’t be real!
Rick," You got to calm down, Morty."
Morty, W-w-w-w-we’re ripped apart!
Rick, Shut up and listen to me!
Morty, This is insane.
Rick," Look, Morty, I’ll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?"
Morty," Rick, what about the reality we left behind?"
Rick," What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty?"
Summer," You know, the thing about a shark… he’s got lifeless eyes… black eyes, like a doll’s eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn’t seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water…"
Jerry, [sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
Beth," Sometimes. But, I’m ashamed to admit, now that they’re gone, I’m finally happy."
Rick," Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged."
Morty," Yeah, Cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I’m gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?"
Cronenberg Rick," Don’t you worry about that sort of thing, Cronenberg Morty. Let’s go make ourselves at home, huh?"

Beth, Hold on.
Summer, What?
Jerry, Yes!
Beth, Called it.
Summer, Why would he choose Veronica?
Jerry, Because he loves her?
Rick," Well if it’s any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid."

Morty," Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions."
Rick," [working on the cable box] 20% accurate, as usual, [snatching the remote from Morty] Morty. [reconnecting the cable box as the TV buffers] The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality."
Jerry," Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?"
Rick, How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? [turns on TV]
Summer, Boring.
Rick," Summer, [belch] you just spent [belch] three months watching a man choose a fake wife."
Jerry," So, what, It’d be better if the people were corn?"
Rick," Jerry, you don’t get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. [changes channel]"
Rick," A movie about a guy eating shit. [changes channel, various people are fighting on TV] A violent Antiques Show… [changes channel]"
Rick, Letterman from a time line where Jerry’s famous. [changes channel]
Jerry, Wait!
Beth, What in the hell?
Rick, I agree. Where’s this going?
Jerry," No, the other thing! Go back!"
Rick," Really? All right, fine."
Rick," All right, Jerry, when you’re right, you’re right. Now I’m hooked."
Rick," Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with ""Schmla""."
Rick," All right, that got that actually got old pretty quick."
Jerry," [sighs] Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?"
Rick," [flipping through the channels] Infinity’s a big number, Jerry. I don’t remember the channel."
Beth," Go back, go back!"
Rick, Jeez. [changes channel]
Summer," Oh my God! Dad’s in ""Cloud Atlas""!"
Jerry," I’m in ""Cloud Atlas""! What’s ""Cloud Atlas""?"
Beth, How is this possible?
Rick," Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry’s a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. [changes channel]"
Rick," Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?"
Rick," [sighs] Here. [stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat] These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. [throws the device into the kitchen] Go fetch!"
Beth and Summer, [at the same time] Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!
Rick," I’m proud of you, Morty."
Morty," Hey man, I don’t give a crap about myself, Rick. Let’s watch some crazy stuff, yo!"
Beth, Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?
Jerry, You’re right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee-- [grabs the device] Give me those! [turns switch]
Beth, What do you see?
Jerry, Whiteness… Pure whiteness.
Jerry," Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!"
Beth," [sighs, taking the device] Haven’t we spent enough time on you? [turns switch] I’m performing surgery… but not on a horse, on a human!"
Jerry," That’s great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon."
Beth, [taking off device] I am a real surgeon.
Jerry," Ahh, uh-- Summer’s turn! [giving Summer the device]"
Summer, Finally! I don’t see anything.
Beth," Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there’s a chance you weren’t even born-- That came out wrong, that came out '‘very wrong."
Summer," Fine, I’ll find a world where you bothered to have me. [turns switch a few times] We’re playing Yahtzee."
 Coming this summer," Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came and that’s when things got knocked into 12th gear."

Old women are coming, and they’re also in the movie, and they’re gonna come, and cross attack these two brothers. But let’s get back to the brothers, because they’re-- they have a strong bond. You don’t want to know about it here, but I’ll tell you one thing: The moon it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It’s two brothers and--and th-they’re It’s called Two brothers.

 Breaking News, Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit after suffering an apparent breakdown.
Jerry, Don’t even think about it.
Rick," Come on, Je- Are you kidding me, Jerry? It’s just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap."
Jerry," [taking then remote] It’s my life, and we’re watching it."
Jerry, Where the hell am I going?
Rick, [belch] What are you asking me for Jerry? [belch] I’m sitting here [belch] trying to figure out why the cops don’t just take you out. Th-- [belch] they’ve got a clear shot to your head. I can’t believe our tax dollars pay for this.
Rick, [rolls his eyes and takes the remote]
Summer," Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers."
Morty," Yeah, Ball Fondlers."
Beth," So, the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people?"
Rick," [tired] Yeah, sweetie, they-- that’s where they live."
Jerry," Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?"
Morty," Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own?"
Summer," Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again?"
Rick," [angry] I don’t know, Summer! I can’t even hear the TV! [stands up, drawing his Portal Gun] All right, that’s it. We’re just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day."
Jerry, Ooh! Family vacation!

Open," Smith kitchen, int. Rick, Jerry, Beth are eating breakfast. Rick is building a robot at the table. Jerry is playing Jerry’s Game]"
Morty Smith," Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?"
Rick Sanchez, Whatever.
Jerry," Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing."
Rick," Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing."
Beth," [typing on phone] Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad."
Morty," [putting away phone, clears throat] Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?"
Jerry," Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days."
Butter robot, What is my purpose?
Rick, Pass the butter.
Rick, Thank you.
Morty, [sighs]
Summer," Dad, I need a ride to work."
Jerry, Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science.
Rick, I’m busy.
Summer, Doing what?
Rick," Uh, anything else?"
Butter robot, What is my purpose?
Rick, You pass butter.
Butter robot, Oh my god.
Rick," Yeah, welcome to the club, pal."
Rick, Since when did you have a job?
Summer, Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.
Rick," Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character."
Summer, Please don’t.
Goldenfold, Oh… when did this stop being jamba juice?
Needful," I’ve just recently opened for business, Mr, um, Goldenfold."
Goldenfold, You know my name? That’s disarming.
Needful, I also know you long for female company.
Goldenfold," You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can’t be filled with jamba juice."
Needful, This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge: one never pays here. Not with money.
Goldenfold, Nothing to read into there! Thanks!
Summer," Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving."
Rick, (inspecting objects) Huh.
Needful," Tell me Rick, what do you desire?"
Rick," Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?"
Needful, What? Sorry?
Rick," I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?"
Summer, Grandpa Rick!
Rick," Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science."
Needful, Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this. [picks up microscope] This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.
Rick, Hahahahaha.
Summer," Grandpa, go home and drink!"
Jerry, Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age.
Morty, Oh. Ok.
Jerry," You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-"
Morty," Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet."
Jerry," [laughing] Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade."
Morty," Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it."
Jerry," Morty, nobody changed the planets."
Morty," I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006."
Jerry," Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree."
Morty, You… disagree?
Jerry," That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball."
Morty," Um, ok, I just have to-"
Jerry, Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?
Morty, Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Dayum!
Jerry, Oh. [coughs] Okay good. This is gonna be fun!
Rick," Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?"
Morty, Um…
Rick," Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius."
Rick, Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.
Morty," Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?"
Rick," Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded."
Morty," Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing."
Rick, Well that’s retarded.
Jerry, What are you guys talking about?
Rick, Apparently nothing.
Jerry," You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you?"
Morty, No!
Rick, It’s not.
Jerry," Shut up, Rick."
Rick, Whoa.
Jerry," I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet planet planet."
Rick," Stay scientific, Jerry."
Goldenfold, This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!
Needful," A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price… for everything! Muahahahaha!"
Goldenfold, (crying) Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-
Rick, This serum should counteract the negative effects.
Goldenfold," [looking into own pants] Holy cats! Ladies, let’s get out of here."
Rick, [giving back microscope] Here. You can have this back.
Needful, You didn’t use it?
Rick," Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say, [scans] a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh."
Needful, Be quiet!
Rick, Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling [scans] beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?
Needful, I find this all quite preposterous!
Rick," Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo. [scans animal fur scarf being tried on by customer] That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?"
Needful, Do I need to call the police?
Rick," Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack."
Summer, Hey! No! Ugh!
Rick, Think you’re so great?
Summer, Stop it!
Summer," No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!"
Summer," Grandpa Rick, I like working here!"
Rick, You work for the devil!
Summer, So what?
 Needful, So what?
Summer," Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye."
Rick, Whoops.
Summer," I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but…"
Needful," It’s fine. Summer, you know your grandfather’s right. This store curses people. That’s my business."
Summer," Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me."
Needful," Please, call me the devil."
Summer," I’d rather not, actually."
Needful," Yes, perhaps not during business hours."
Jerry," I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first! [hangs up] I think I know what the A in NASA stands for."
Morty," Dad, what’s your endgame?"
Jerry," Ain’t no game, sucka."
Morty, Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!
Jerry," Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty!"
 Morty," Whoa, whoa! Whoa!"
Jerry, What the hell?
Flippynips," I’m King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!"
Flippynips, We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!
Jerry, I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction.
Flippynips, I’d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.
Jerry, Oh. I…
Flippynips," Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he’s creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!"
Jerry, Pluto… is a planet.
Flippynips," Pluto’s a fucking planet, bitch!"
Morty," [to himself] Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head."
Needful," If it’s athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might-"
Vagina, [taking ball] I’ll take it!
Needful, But I haven’t even-
Vagina," Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye."
Needful," Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather’s outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I’ve had since Salem!"
Summer, Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?
Needful, Is that the vegan place?
Summer," Yeah, I love their soup."
Needful, I’m kind of souped out.
Needful," Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?"
Needful," Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!"
Tate," Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s free, right?"
Summer, Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money. [laughing]
Needful, [laughing] That was perfect.
Tate," You pay with the curses, right?"
Needful," Um, I… well-"
Needful, But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?
Tate," Well, I’m going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?"
Needful, What?
Needful, First… and…
Needful, Diabolical son of a mother-
Hostess," We’re back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?"
Jerry, Pluto is a planet.
Host, [laughing] How about that?
Hostess, Wow. I love it!
Scroopy Noopers, Morty Smith. I’m Scroopy Noopers. I’m a scientist. Can I show you something?
Morty, Uh… I’d better not.
Scroopy Noopers, [pulling out a gun] Right now.
Scroopy Noopers," The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks."
Scroopy Noopers," There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won’t wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof. [At the last word, he blows a handful of blue dust into the air]"
Morty, Um… A party?
Scroopy Noopers, Is everyone in your family an idiot?
Morty, For sure me and my dad are.
Scroopy Noopers," [sigh] Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives."
Morty," Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure."
Summer," Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of!"
Summer, Ah! Oh my god!
Summer, Oh my god. (using monkey paw) I wish this desk was lighter!
Summer, (using monkey paw) I wish this knot was looser!
Summer, Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing? (using monkey paw) I wish I knew CPR!
Summer," One, two, three! One, two, three!"
Needful," [coughing] Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw."
Summer, Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?
Needful," I’m the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?"
Summer, You haven’t failed.
Needful," People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I’m smart and funny."
Summer," No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?"
Needful," Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name it."
Summer, I wanna help you.
Needful, Clever twist.
Summer," I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated."
Rick," Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens."
Rick," Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?"
Summer, Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.
Rick," Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’"
Summer," That was important to you, wasn’t it?"
Rick," Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes."
Summer, He tried to kill himself.
Rick, Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
Summer," But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up."
Rick," Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care."
Summer," Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care."
Rick, So?
Summer, So… have fun not caring.
Rick, I always do.
Summer, Good.
Rick," Yeah, it is good. It’s the best."
Summer, I’m sure it is. Bye.
Rick, Later!
Customer, I’m here to pick up my undead cat and child.
Rick," Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec."
Employee, These are the forms for the employee health plan.
Rick," Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh."
Rick, I just got bored. Everybody out.
Jerry," Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project."
Morty," Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!"
Jerry," Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?"
Morty, You told me science wasn’t easy!
Jerry," I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son."
Morty," Dad, their whole planet is dying!"
Jerry, Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.
Jerry," What’s up, Pluto?"
Plutonian woman," Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on."
Jerry," My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto."
Plutonian man, My god! The man’s a genius!
Morty," Um, excuse me? [taps champagne glass with spoon]"
Jerry," Morty, what?"
Morty," Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?"
Jerry," ...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?"
Plutonians, [laughing]
Jerry," I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?"
Morty," Good one, dad."
Rick," [looks into Morty’s room] Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh. [goes into kitchen] Hey Beth? Hello? [Goes into living room] Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? [sighs]"
Rick," Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…"
Butter robot, I am not programmed for friendship.
Rick, Suit yourself.
Rick, Hey! [clears throat] Hey. What’s going on?
Morty," Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?"
Rick, Whatever.
Flippynips," Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!"
Jerry," I’m flattered, and humbled."
Flippynips," Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that."
Policeman, Your highness! We’ve captured Scroopy Noopers!
Scroopy Noopers, You animals! Animals!
Flippynips," Ooh, look whose little journey’s come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!"
Scroopy Noopers," You can’t kill the truth, father!"
Jerry, What?
Flippynips," I can see you’re confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-"
Jerry," Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?"
Flippynips," The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf."
Jerry, It’s a what?
Flippynips," Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That’s what I meant. Knock ‘em dead out there, you. [sips champagne]"
Jerry, Pluto is…
Jerry, [sigh] Not a planet.
Crowd, Boo! [throws things]
Jerry," Ow! It’s not a planet! Hey! It’s not a planet! I’m an idiot, and I love my son!"
Needful," It’s been a long six hours, but we’ve overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 e-nomenon, n33dful.com! Spelled with 3s instead of Es."
Crowd, Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!
Needful," Okay, that’s it! We just got bought by Google!"
Crowd, Yeah!
Summer," Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make?"
Needful, Haha. ‘We.’ [pushes Summer away] This is my business! Security!
Summer, Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me?
Needful," I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg’s balls dropped. I’m the devil, beeyotch! What what!"
Jerry, Hey!
Jerry, Hey Morty.
Morty, Oh! Hey dad! [closes laptop] Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?
Jerry," Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again."
Morty," Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that."
Jerry," Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?"
Morty, Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A. [Holds up butter robot]
Butter robot, Butter.
Jerry, But-
Morty," You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!"
Jerry, Oh. I uh- I think I underst-
Morty," You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man."
Jerry, I get it! Say no more.
Morty," I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-"
Jerry, I got it! Noted! Goodnight!
Rick, How’s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?
Summer, He dumped me.
Rick," Oof, sorry."
Summer, Did we learn a lesson here I’m not seeing?
Rick," Hm, not sure."
Summer," Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn’t realise how much you valued my approval?"
Rick," No, that’s dumb."
Summer," Nah, not satisfying."
Rick," I’ll tell you what though, if it’s satisfaction you’re after, I think I might have an idea. [whispers]"
Summer, [listening] Uh huh… uh huh… uh huh totally let’s do it!
Needful, And that’s how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront! Thank you Seattle!
Needful, Rick? Summer?
Rick, Stupid mother-
Summer, Stupid bitch!
Rick, Stupid motherfucker!
Summer, Get some!
Rick, How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?
Needful, Ugh… Why?
Summer, (lifting Mr. Needful by the neck of his shirt) Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.
Rick, We did it!
Summer," Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha!"
Rick," Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!"
Summer, Yeah bro!
Rick, Hahaha!
Summer, Yeah.

Beth," No… well, it might be…"

Beth," Fine, but also, tomorrow is your 1 year anniversary back in our lives. I’m gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes."
Rick," Oh, there’s no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine."
Beth," Happy anniversary, dad!"
Rick," Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. [takes bite] Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me."

Riq IV," Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls."
Crowd rick," Uh uh, not you!"
 Population," A whole lot, sonny!”]"
Armed Ricks," (Ugh, son of a-, aw geez, aw man, we lost him, etc. Ad lib)"
Rick, That’ll keep ‘em [belches] busy for a while.
Morty," Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves?"
Rick," 'Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names."
Rick, By finding the real Rick killer.
Morty," I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers."
Rick," Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now."
Beth, Who wants lemonade?
Beth," Aww, thank [belches] you!"
All Ricks, Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!
Jerry," Uh, hello?"
Jerry," Rick! Heyy. Haha, what’s- what’s up?"
Jerry, What?
Jerry," Rick, no! Mortyyyy!"
All Ricks," [laughing] (Look at his face! I can’t believe our daughter married you, too easy, etc. Ad lib)"
Rick, The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.
Chair waiter," Phones á la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. Anything else?"
Rick," Yeah, more phonesticks please."
Phone waiter," Right away, sir."
Morty," You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines."
Rick," Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage."
Morty," Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?"
Rick," Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh, [clears throat] Morty waves."
Morty, Um… because… our personalities are so different?
Rick," Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!"
Chair waiter," Hey, you didn’t pay your bill!"
Rick," Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?"
Morty," Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over."
Rick," Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found."
Morty," Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?"
Rick," Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is."
Morty," Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building!"
Rick," Not people, Morty. Mortys."
Rick," Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, mother*cker. I fiddled with a [belches] concept like this once."
Rick," On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable. [pauses as Morty glares at him] Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship."
Beth, Coffee time!
All Ricks, (Yeah! That’s what I like to hear! etc. Ad lib)
Jerry, Ugh.
Doofus Rick, Hi Jerry!
Jerry," Leave me alone, I’m working!"
Doofus Rick," Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?"
Jerry, Ugh. I’m- I’m in between advertising jobs.
Doofus Rick," Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?"
Jerry," W-well, it’s a little more complicated than that…"
Doofus Rick," Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together!"
Jerry," [Looks around for hiding Ricks] Dude, are you… wh- you’re being a dick, right?"
Doofus Rick," Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn’t want to offend you in any way!"
Jerry, You’re really a Rick?
Doofus Rick, Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty’s a Morty!
Jerry," Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ‘Mask.’ You know, the one with Cher in it?"
Doofus Rick," That’s right, Jerry! He-he’s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He’s Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because… I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I’d love ‘em if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry."
Doofus Rick, I’m not doofus Rick! I’m Rick J-19-Zeta-7!
Doofus Rick, Hey! I don’t eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!
Doofus Rick," I guess it’s only fair to tell you now, Jerry… I’m the worst Rick of them all."
Jerry," According to who? Other versions of you? If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself."
Doofus Rick," Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that’s why you work in advertising!"
Jerry, The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.
Morty, You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object!
Rick," Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!"
Morty," You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield!"
Rick," Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice."
Rick," Great, nice work, Morty."
Rick, Urrgh.
Evil Rick," Ooh, look at you, C-137! You’re- aren’t you a tough customer?"
Rick," The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude."
Evil Rick," Not in this dimension it isn’t. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before."
Rick, Well lah-dee-dah. [slow claps]
Evil Rick," Hey, that’s mine!"
Rick," I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape."
Morty," I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster."
Rick," Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty."
Morty, W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid.
Evil Rick, Take his Morty away.
Evil Morty, Come with me.
Morty," Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?"
Morty," Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there?"
Evil Morty, It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.
Evil Morty, In here.
Evil Rick," Ahh, isn’t it beautiful?"
Rick," Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!"
Lobster alien, Hehehehehehehehehe.
Rick, That guy got it.
Evil Rick," Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You’re missing my symphony."
Rick," Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!"
Lobster alien, Hehehehehehehehehe.
Rick, This guy is on it!
Evil Rick," He’s not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That’s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds."
Lobster alien, Hehehehehehehehehe.
Rick, Awww.
Evil Rick," See, Rick, you’re not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We’re not so [belch] different, you and I."
Rick," Yeah, duh!"
Evil Rick," See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed ‘em out from most evil to least evil. Here’s where I am. And look at right here’s where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird."
Rick," I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going."
Evil Rick," Please. I think I’m doing pretty good on my own. I’m simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you."
Doofus Rick," Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies!"
Jerry, It’s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order!
Doofus Rick," Well, come on, I can’t take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C’mere Jerry!"
Jerry," Hey, uh. C’mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something."
Jerry," Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but… you’re a genius scientist, what do you think? There’s little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!"
Doofus Rick," You know Jerry, I’m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is… you bought ‘em ‘cause you like ‘em. They have value to you. That’s what matters."
Jerry, (tearing up) How long are you staying?
Doofus Rick, Until we find your Rick.
Jerry, (hugging doofus Rick) I found mine. I found mine.
Religious Morty," There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world."
Religious Morty, We’re giving in to the power of the One True Morty. One day he will return!
All religious Mortys, Praise the One True Morty!
Hammer Morty, I’m more than just a hammer!
Religious Morty, He is the one true Morty! The one true Morty!
All Mortys, Hooray!
Lobster alien," Hey, keep it down!"
All Mortys, Raaaaugh!
Evil Rick," You’ve lived quite a life, Rick. It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through."
Evil Rick, You’re crying? Over a Morty?
Rick," No, I’m just allergic to dipshits."
Evil Rick," Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe, it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys."
Evil Rick," Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!"
Rick, Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!
Rick," Point taken, but this is [belches] no time for arcs."
Doofus Rick," Well Jerry, I [belches] guess this means goodbye."
Jerry," W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe… you know… get rid of him? I’m not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I’m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-"
Doofus Rick," Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn’t work. It’s time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya."
Rick," Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it."
Morty," Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass."
Rick," Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off."
Morty," Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?"
Rick," Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would [belch] go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty."
Morty," It would go without saying, huh?"
Rick," Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?"
Morty, Nah… (to himself) The Mortyest Morty…
Rick," Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody."
Morty," Oh yeah, how’s that?"
Rick, I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.
Doofus Rick," Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?"
Rick," Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?"
Jerry," Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors."
Rick," Alright. Okay, get out."
Rick," What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like [belches] ten Ricks to call right now!"

Rick and Morty, Season: 1 Episode: 11
Summer," Bye, mom! Bye, dad!"
Morty, Drive carefully!
Rick," Have fun, you two."
Beth," Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... (Sarcastic and moody) Titanic-themed getaway."
Jerry," (Finishes packing the car, and closes the door of the car.) Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. (Opens the passenger seat door.)"
Beth," Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here."
Rick," I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I (belching) have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage."
Beth," (Angry) Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. (Opens the car door off screen.)"
Morty," Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time."
Beth and Jerry in unison, That's right.
Jerry, Wait... What?
Rick," Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song ""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song? (Elbows Morty.) From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?"
Rick," No-nobody? (Angry) A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip."
Jerry, (Serious) Not one thing out of place.
Jerry, Not a single thing.
Summer," (Happy) Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party."
Summer, (Off screen) I found Jello.
Summer," Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. (Grabs another box) Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. (Stops the call)"
Morty," Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?"
Summer," Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty."
Morty," Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!"
Rick," (Pulls out a tray with canapes on it, and places it on the bench off screen.) Uh, Summer, you can't have a party."
Summer, Ugh.
Rick," (Back on screen.) Because (burp) I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! (burp)"
Morty," Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!"
Summer, What do you mean you're having a party? (Sarcastic) Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?
Rick," ""Glip glop?"" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that."
Summer, Is that like their n-word?
Rick," It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. (Drinks from a soda can.)"
Morty," Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --"
Summer, (Interrupts Morty) screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.
Rick," That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17."
Summer, Why do you party?
Rick," To get (burp) wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!"
Summer, Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.
Rick," Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. (Places a piece of food into his canapes to finish preparing them.)"
Tour Guide," After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths."
Jerry, A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?
Tour Guide," I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable."
Jerry," (Notices the front of the Titanic, full of people.) Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow!"
Beth," (Bored and unimpressed) Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read."
Beth," Do you mind if I skip the whole ""king of the world"" bit?"
Jerry," Well, it's not the ""king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. (Grabs Beth's hat and places it on her head.) This is where rose says, ""I'm flying, Jack!"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone."
Beth," (Looks to her right, and smiles.) Well, what about her?"
Beth," Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?"
Lucy," (Shy) I, uh -- I could get into trouble."
Beth, (Takes off her hat and places it onto Lucy's.) We won't tell.
Jerry, So... You're a Titanic fanatic?
Lucy," Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate."
Jerry, Happy to help... rose.
Tammy," (To a girl) I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it..."
Summer, Brad! Hey!
Brad, Yo.
Tammy," (To the girl) Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk."
Brad, Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.
Birdperson, The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?
Summer, Ugh! Grandpa!
Rick, Birdperson!
Birdperson, I am pleased there is no emergency.
Rick," Oh, there's an emergency, all right. (He puts his arm around Birdperson) A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?"
Birdperson, It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.
Rick," Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. (Leads Birdperson into the house) Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson."
Morty," Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?"
Rick," Uh... people? Mm, six."
Rick," Yo! What up, my glip glops?!"
Morty," Oh, man!"
Morty," (Walking around picking up trash from the ground and putting it in a garbage bag. The house is very crowded) (Huff) (Huff) Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?"
Morty," Hey, uh, what the hell?!"
like creature with items stuck inside of it, Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. (Exits the room)
Morty," Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!"
Blue alien, Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.
Morty, Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.
Morty," Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!"
Gearhead, The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.
Rick," Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally."
Morty," Rick, you got to stop --"
Rick, Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
Morty," (Waves) Hey, how's it --"
Rick," (Interrupts Morty) Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. (Rick quickly leaves them)"
Gearhead," How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?"
Morty, Uh... Not at all.
Gearhead," Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago..."
Rick," Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?"
Morty," Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!"
Rick," Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed."
Rick, Have a little perspective.
Squanchy," Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!"
Rick, Aw! Squanchy!
Squanchy, Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?
Rick," Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!"
Squanchy," All right! I like your squanch! (He runs away, excited)"
Morty," Uh, Rick, what exactly is ""squanching""?"
Rick," Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax."
Morty," Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!"
Rick," Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?"
Morty," Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?"
Morty, (In slow motion) Jessica.
Rick," Knock it off, Slow Mobius!"
Slow Mobius," Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!"
Morty, I can't believe she's here.
Rick," Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. (He shoves Morty away. Morty follows Jessica.)"
Rick," Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood."
Jerry," Oh, Rose."
Lucy, Whee!
Jerry, Is that what I think it is?
Lucy," (Off screen) Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie."
Lucy, It's so romantic.
Jerry, I can't wait to do that with Beth.
Lucy," I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested."
Jerry," (Gasp!) Look! (Points at the iceberg in front of the boat, as it rises higher out of the water)"
Voice through speaker," Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed."
Voice through speaker," Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed."
Jerry, No! What happened?!
Lucy, Their rail system must have failed.
Passengers," Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!"
Guy, Totally gonna get laid tonight. (Drinks from the cup.)
Tammy, (In awe) I like your feathers.
Birdperson, They are designed to attract the attention of the female.
Tammy, It's working.
Birdperson," Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate."
Tammy, I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... (Whispers into Birdperson's ear.)
Birdperson, I believe birdperson can arrange that.
Nancy," Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while."
Girl," Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her."
Summer, (Lying) Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.
Rick," Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. (He accidentally splashes some of his drink into Nancy's face.) Everybody should be welcome."
Rick," Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? (Tries to hide his face from Abradolph Lincoler.)"
Summer, I thought everyone was welcome.
Rick," It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out (burp) it just adds up to a lame, weird loser."
Abradolph Lincoler," Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being."
Abradolph Lincoler, (Walks closer to Rick) But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! (He accidentally bumps Brad with his arm. Brad is standing next to Jessica and Morty)
Brad," Whoa. What's up, man?"
Abradolph Lincoler," I have no quarrel with you, boy."
Brad," ""Boy""? What's that supposed to mean? (Gets up into Abradolph Lincoler's face)"
Abradolph Lincoler," (Threatened) It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... (Looks at Rick for help)"
Rick," Don't look at me, dude."
Abradolph Lincoler," Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --"
Brad, (Angry) So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!
Abradolph Lincoler," Well, no, but... You know?"
Brad, What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?
Jessica," Leave him alone, Brad."
Brad," Stay out of this, Jessica!"
Rick," Kick his ass, Brad! (chanting)"
Everyone except Morty and Jessica, (Chanting) Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!
Jessica, Brad!
Morty, Rick!
Rick," (Shoves Morty towards the door where jessica went) I just did you a favor, Morty."
Morty, Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.
Jessica, (Annoyed) Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.
Morty," Jessica, can I show you something?"
Jessica, Wow! Look at all this stuff.
Morty, (Walks over to the shelves and picks up a circular device.) Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.
Jessica, It's beautiful.
Morty," You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you."
Jesica," What's that, Morty?"
Morty, I think that you're the most --
Jessica," No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. (Points at the shaking closet.)"
Jessica, Aah!
Morty," Oh, my God!"
Squanchy," Hey, I'm squanching in here!"
Morty," Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!"
Morty," Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!"
Rick," Huh. Big star in the sky. (Breathes in) Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. (Turns around, excited) We'll be fine! Let's party!"
Stereo," ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪"
Summer," I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now."
Rick," Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. (Sips from his drink)"
Morty," How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!"
Rick," (Holds Morty to get his attention) Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax! (Lets go) It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. (Rick is still scanning with his device. It suddenly starts to beep.) Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here."
Morty," Okay. Let's go, then."
Morty," W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick."
Rick," (Makes Morty let go) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?"
Summer, Yeah. Me too. I should stay.
Abradolph Lincoler, You guys have any aspirin?
Rick," Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you."
Abradolph Lincoler," Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured."
Rick," Shut up, Lincoler. (Shoves him away) It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room."
Summer," (Grabs Nancy's shoulders) Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too."
Nancy, What? Why -- why me?
Summer," Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. (Shoves Nancy towards Morty and Abradolph Lincoler)"
Jerry," (Annoyed) Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken."
Beth, (Sigh) I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. (Walks away from Jerry)
Jerry, But -- but --
Lucy," You see, Jerry? (She puts her hand on Jerry's shoulder) May I show you something?"
Lucy," Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater."
Jerry," I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a ""Titanic"" failure. (Turns to face Lucy) Get it?"
Jerry, (Shocked and confused) Ooh!
Lucy," Draw me, Jerry."
Jerry," (Awkwardly glancing at her body) Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind."
Lucy, But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.
Jerry," Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh."
Lucy," (Lifts up a gun she has in her hand, and aims it at Jerry. She walks towards him) You are gonna draw me."
Jerry, Aah! (Backs away)
Lucy, Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there. (Points at an old-fashion car with the gun)
Abradolph Lincoler," (Thinking) It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --"
Morty," (Interupts him to shut him up) Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close."
Nancy, (Points at big pink crystals growing out of the ground) There they are!
Abradolph Lincoler, Wait. Something's not right.
Abradolph Lincoler," Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! (He lunges at the creature, as he tackles it down. Nancy and Morty quickly grab some crystals and put them in a small bag.)"
Nancy, Summer's gonna like me again.
Morty," Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!"
Abradolph Lincoler," Mein journey is over, Morty. (Grunts) I have something important to tell you."
Gearhead," ♪ And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪"
Morty," (Huff) Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! (He hands Rick the bag)"
Rick," All right! You did it, Morty. (Walks away)"
Morty," Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father."
Morty," He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. (Morty tears up and wipes his eye) He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died."
Rick," Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. (Rick cuts up the crystals into dust with his credit card, and snorts it up. Ricks eyes turn blue) And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something."
Morty, Wait a minute. What?
Rick, (Dancing) ♪ Put your right foot forward ♪ ♪ and your left foot back ♪ ♪ then fucking slide around ♪ ♪ like on a nordictrack ♪
Rick," ♪ move to the left ♪ ♪ step to the right ♪ ♪ wiggle your elbows, and look ♪ ♪ up into the light ♪"
Song," ♪ it's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪ ♪ it's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪"
Rick," Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!"
Song," ♪ It's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪"
Rick," That's the Rick dance! All right! (burp) Whoa, man!"
Morty, What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!
Rick," What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. (His eye color turns back to normal) Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. (He scratches the side of his face)"
Morty," That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!"
Rick," Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?"
Rick," Uh, squanchy?"
Squanchy, Don't squaunch at me.
Morty," All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now."
Rick," All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!"
Tammy," Boo! You suck, whatever your name is."
Everyone, Boo!
Rick," Morty, you're the worst, Morty."
Gearhead, But these gears just started turnin'.
Lucy," Almost finished, Jerry?"
Jerry," Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes."
Lucy, (Still holding the gun) I'm sure it's good enough. Move!
Lucy," Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. (She licks the car, as the floor of the car detatches.) But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me."
Lucy, No mess. No clean.
Jerry, (Reieved) Beth!
Beth, Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.
Beth, I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.
Jerry," What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? (Feeling scared due to a flashback)"
Beth, What?
Beth," Well, at least you got all this free stuff. (She enters the door into the drivers seat, as Jerry closes the back door, and tries to fit a painting board from the titanic boat.)"
Beth, Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.
Jerry," (Puts the board into the passenger seat) Ugh! I'm not going to fit. (Hangs onto the board, recreating Jack's death from the Titanic movie. He slowly slips off) Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and --"
Beth," (Interrupts Jerry) Jerry, just leave the door."
Jerry," It's not a door, Beth. It's debris."
Beth, I don't care. Just leave it.
Jerry," Yeah. Okay. (He takes out the board and leaves it on the ground, as he gets into the car. He has Lucy's necklace. He drops it out of the car window. Lucy is seen hanging onto the underneath of their car. The car starts moving)"
Lucy," Ahahahah! ""Cape fear""! Hahahaha! ""Cape fear""! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from ""cape fear""."
Lucy, Ugh! Auh! Augh! (huff) (huff)
Squanchy," Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!"
Summer," Cool. I'm coming, too."
Squanchy," (Stops Summer) Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party."
Summer, What?
Squanchy, Nancy told us what a bitch you are. (Leaves)
Summer," Guys, seriously. Nancy?"
Nancy," Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for."
Summer," Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. (To Rick) You're so wise."
Rick," (Groan) (Mumbles) Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... (Rick falls asleep, snoring)"
Birdperson, May I assist you with that?
Morty," Uh, sure, yeah. (Takes the trash and puts it in the garbage bag) Thanks. (Continues to pick up trash)"
Birdperson," Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means?"
Morty," Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase."
Birdperson," (Walks up to Morty) It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me."""
Morty," Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically."
Birdperson," No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself."
Morty," Come on, um..."
Birdperson, Birdperson.
Morty," Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole."
Birdperson, Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.
Morty, You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.
Morty, I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.
Birdperson," My people have another saying-- ""gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means, ""whatever lets you sleep at night""."
Summer," Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner."
Birdperson," This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!"
Birdperson, Caw!
Summer, Wow. We are so screwed.
Morty," (Walks over to Rick, and shakes him) Rick, wake up."
Rick, Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.
Morty," Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home."
Rick," Augh. Uh, all -- all right. (Sits up and grabs a glass of water sitting on the coffee table.) All right. Hold -- hold on. (He drinks from the glass) Ahh! So good."
Morty," Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway."
Rick, Bring me the thing.
Morty, What -- what thing?
Rick," (Rubbing his forehead and focusing) The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps."
Morty, Rick! That describes everything in your garage!
Summer, (Walks up to Rick with a remove device) Do you mean this?
Rick, Summer (burp) for for the win.
Rick," All right, that should do it."
Morty, Whoa! What did you do?
Rick," Uh, s-see for yourself."
Summer, Whoa!
Rick," Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that."
Morty, For how long?
Rick, I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?
Summer, Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?
Rick, Worst movie ever.
Summer, Dumb.
Morty," Ooh, boy, what a waste of time."
Morty," Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen."
Summer, This has been so much fun.
Morty," Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that ""wubba lubba dub dub"" thing that you usually say."
Rick, Don't need to. I have a (burp) new catchphrase.
Morty," Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?"
Rick, love my grandkids.
Morty and Summer in unison, (Hug Rick) Aww.
Rick," Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, ""I don't give a fuck""."
Rick and the song," ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ ♪ just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ Roll credits! ♪ Just shake that a-- Roll the credits! Go! ♪ Just shake that ass That's the end of season one!"
Rick," That's the end, motherfucker! ""I don't give a fuck"" is my new catchphrase! Fuck you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, motherfucker! Yeah!"
Abradolph Lincoler, Revenge.
Abradolph Lincoler, What?!
Shirtless guy, Party!
Shirtless guy," Whoo, baby!"
Abradolph Lincoler," Please, stop!"
Shirtless Guy," Hey, brah!"
Abradolph Lincoler, I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?
Shirtless Guy," Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!"
in, Rick and Morty Transcripts
Rick and Morty, Season: 2 Episode: 1
Enter, Summer)
Summer," Hurry up Morty, Grampa’s about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom."
Morty," I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I’ve been doing it for six months!"
Summer, Then you’ve been doing it wrong for six months. Oh my god is that mildew?
Morty, It’s not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
Summer," You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?"
Morty, What? What kind of monster are you?
Summer, A competent one.
Rick, Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about. The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a *ck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let’s get this dumb universe rolling. Let’s do this thing.
Rick," Alright, listen you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world’s time is gonna be fine, but our time’s gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
Morty, Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
Rick," It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don’t touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."
Morty," Wait a minute, what?"
Rick, And away we go!
Morty," Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?"
Rick," Shhh, Morty!"
Jerry," …A THING OR TWO ABOUT… wait, what? Was the house…? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
Rick," Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you’re at. Hi, sweety."
Beth," Hi, dad."
Beth," Summer, Morty, are you okay?"
Morty, W-We just missed you a lot.
Summer," Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though."
Rick," Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don’t you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here’s five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I’m just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts."
Jerry," This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won’t save you. I’ll get my jacket."
Beth," Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?"
Summer, *Gasp*
Morty, Oh!
Rick, Uh oh.
Jerry," Yeah, I like it this way. I’m not stupid."
Morty, Phew…
Summer, *Exhales*
Rick," Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what’s going on. (Morty and Summer laugh) Oh you agree, huh? (Summer: Funny) You like that Red Grin Grumble reference? (Summer: Yeah.) Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father’s children. Think for yourselves, don’t be sheep."
Summer," God, I feel terrible."
Rick," Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. (Rick opens refrigerator) [Trans. Inside refrigerator] One minute you’re falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!"
Morty," Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer’s job to put the mattress under-"
Summer," (interrupting) Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. (Summer pokes Morty.)"
Morty, Nuh uh!
Summer, Yeah huh!
Rick," Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank’s money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson."
Morty," Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man."
Summer," Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!"
Morty, You shut up you big… female asshole!
Alternate Morty," Hey, don’t shove me!"
Summer, I didn’t!
Morty, You didn’t what?
Alternate Summer, What’s your problem?
Morty, What’s yours?
Alternate Summer, Shut up!
Morty, You shut up!
Rick, Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
All Ricks," Oh god, oh no, what did you guys just do?"
All Summers," Wait, what am I saying?"
Rick, *belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
All Mortys, Oh man… I don’t feel good.
All Mortys," Wait, who said that?"
All Ricks," Alright both of you, just don’t move, don’t speak, don’t think. I have to check something."
All Mortys, What’s going on Rick?
All Summers, What’s happening Grampa?
All Ricks, Shut up! (Rick turns on a monitor) Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
All Ricks, Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that’s split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we’re exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We’re entirely hypothetical.
All Mortys, But I thought there were infinite timelines.
All Ricks," We’re not on any timeline, dummy. Look."
All Mortys, Oh my god!
All Summers, Are those cats?
All Ricks," I assume they’re Schrodinger’s cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren’t, just like us."
All Ricks, “Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family’s ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They’re probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.
Jerry, Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?
Beth, You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.
Beth, Holy shit! What happened?
Jerry, I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.
Beth, W-what?
Jerry, This is Rum Raisin!
Beth, It’s still alive.
Jerry," Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or-"
Beth," It’s not an armadillo, asshole!"
Jerry," I thought that’s what a man’s supposed to say, it’s not like I could have actually done it."
Beth," If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-"
Jerry," It’s okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you’re a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon."
Beth, So…
Jerry, Well don’t different animals-
Beth, Require different levels of skill to keep alive?
Jerry, Oh god…
Beth," Get the deer in the car, Jerry."
Jerry, Yes Beth.
All Ricks," This is why you don’t freeze time, you guys. It’s incredibly irresponsible."
All Ricks," Look, there’s no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn’t. And we’ve got about four hours to be “is”."
All Ricks, We “isn’t”
All Ricks," Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it’s impossible that I didn’t nail this, I’m probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time."
All Ricks," Whatever you’re asking, the answer is I’m amazing. And away we go!"
Rick," Huh, what do you know, it’s working"
Rick, Oh shit.
All Ricks, What the hell is wrong with you two!? I-I m- I m- I mean you 4!?
All Ricks," Good I’m glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you’re both *belch* all over the damn place. We’ve been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!"
All Mortys," Well you don’t exactly make it easy, Rick!"
All Ricks," Alright, cool it, I see what’s happening here. You’re both young, you’re both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa’s favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa’s concerned, you’re both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway."
Beth," Emergency, wounded deer coming in."
Vet," 3. Excuse me, you can’t be back here."
Beth," I’m a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake."
Vet," That’s my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I’m sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-"
Beth," As a vet, I’m sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let’s save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it’s time to save a life!"
Vet, Geez…
Beth," That’s odd, this deer’s wounded."
Jerry," Uh, yeah, I was there, you don’t have to rub it in."
Beth, I mean it’s been shot. With a gun.
Hunter, My gun.
Vet," May I help you, sir?"
Hunter," No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me."
Beth," *sigh* We don’t have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline!"
Vet," Look, I don’t know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal."
Hunter, I’m calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you’re as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.
Beth," In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!"
All Ricks," So in conclusion, you’re both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can’t tell the two of you half the time because I don’t go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?"
All Mortys and All Summers, Yes.
All Ricks," Alright, perfect. Sit still, *belch* arms down, I’m gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa."
All Ricks," Huh, that’s weird. Oh my god."
All Summers, What?
All Ricks, That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
All Mortys, Rick what the hell are you doing?
All Ricks, Saving our lives. After he takes me out he’s gonna be coming for you!
All Summers, Who?
All Ricks, Me!
All Summers, Ahh!
All Mortys, Whoa whoa!
All Ricks," Oh god, now there’s three of them, we’re outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don’t don’t do that, they’ll know… wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don’t really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK *CKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?"
Beth," You son of a bitch, you don’t stop living until I SAY SO!"
Lawyer, Michael.
Vet, Who’s this now?
Hunter, My lawyer.
Lawyer," I’m here to notify you ma’am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter’s property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies. It’s called Brad’s law. We can’t make you stop the surgery, but at this point you’re performing it on venison."
Hunter," Actually, I’ve decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict. I’m sure it’s ruined the meat. I’m just gonna use the head for my rec room wall."
Jerry, She normally works on horses.
Beth," Jerry, if you’re not gonna help, get the *ck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!"
Vet, Jesus…
All Ricks," Shh shh… I know where you are, you creepy old monster… I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I’m going? You think I’m standing here? Well maybe you’re right!"
All Summers," Holy shit, now what?"
All Mortys," Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn’t that mean that we’re all synchronized?"
All Summers, Right.
All Mortys," Okay… so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain."
All Summers, Right…
All Mortys, I think I’m certain we’re F’d in the A.
All Ricks," Oh god, my head. What did you guys do?"
All Mortys," We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture."
All Summers, You tried to kill yourself!
All Ricks," Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don’t expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we’ve got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it’s basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet."
All Summers, Well is there some way you can prove you’re not a threat to yourself and others anymore?
All Ricks," Ah, for god’s sake, alright here, give me the time crystal."
All Mortys, W-what’re you doing?
All Ricks," Calling myself. Here, listen, *belch* it’ll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I’m calling myself."
All Rick phones," Hello, Rick here."
All Ricks," Don’t fall for it, it’s a bit."
All Rick phones," Just kidding, haha! You just got Ricked. You’ve reached Rick’s voicemail, you know what to do *beep*."
All Ricks," Hey Rick, it’s Rick. Listen, I’m sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I’m blown up. Three new voicemails. *voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one. *voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we’re cool now."
All Summers," Okay, well we’re still not gonna let you out of this crate."
All Ricks, Fine I’ll just do it myself.
All Mortys, If you could get out that whole time why didn’t you?
All Ricks," Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That’s the difference between you and me. I’m certain, and you’re a walking burlap sack filled with turds."
All Mortys," You know, geez Rick, y—y—you’re really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt."
Testicle Monster A," Ey, ye ey, quit yellin’ quit yellin’."
Testicle Monster A," What the *ck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!"
All Ricks, *sigh*
Testicle Monster A, How did this happen?
Testicle Monster A," Shut the *ck up! Oh, damn, I’m from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o’ y’all. Now let’s just see what we got here for a second."
All Ricks,' *'groan*
Testicle Monster A," Ay, damn it, were you tryin’ to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you’re standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?"
All Mortys," Oh way to go, Rick."
All Summers," Yeah Grampa, way to go."
All Ricks," Oh, what you’re just gonna listen to this guy now? He’s got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land."
Testicle Monster A," Shut up. Here, put these on. They’ll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y’all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!"
Testicle Monster A," Exactly, because you’re being obstinate."
Rick," Yes, we’re back, problem solved."
Summer," Yes, we’re back to our own time."
Morty," Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it."
Testicle Monster A," Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don’t break your weak ass time again."
Rick, How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They’re really embarassing.
Testicle Monster A," Well since you’re goin’ to time prison, I’d say you can keep em on forever."
Summer, Time prison?
Testicle Monster A," Yeah, well I don’t know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin’ ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen."
Summer, You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?
Rick," I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don’t exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there’s a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!"
Testicle Monster A, Ututututut! You’d better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.
Vet, Hmm…
Beth, Isn’t there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?
Lawyer," That’s right Mrs. Smith, *whispers* give in to your anger. Neglect that deer."
Jerry," Honey, it’s gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country’s top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends."
Vet, I guess that’s the end of that.
Lawyer," There is just one more thing. According to this state’s veterinarian statute, this animal can’t be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn’t hack it."
Jerry, We did it…
Testicle Monster A," (On phone) Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I’m talking ‘bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you’ve get to the dolphin people you’ve gone too far. Alright man, I’ll talk to you later, okay. (hangs up) You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever."
Morty, Why are you doing this?
Testicle Monster A," You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin’ you guys in is my ticket up."
Rick, What if I told you there’s a huge ticket up right behind you?
Testicle Monster A, You really think I’m that stupid?
Rick," Alright, hear me out on this. You’re immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there’s 100% chance that you’ll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you."
Testicle Monster A, I cannot argue that.
Rick," Ah, god, gross and weird!"
Testicle Monster A, Chris!
Testicle Monster A, You killed my gun!
Rick," Summer, Morty, take off your collars!"
Testicle Monster A, What? What the hell are you doing?
Rick, Good question. I suppose the answer is: I’m not certain!
Testicle Monster A," Oh, no, what are you doin’?"
Testicle Monster A," Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago."
Zooms in to only show one timeline, Timeline 23)
Testicle Monster A," Ow, I’m defeated…"
Jerry," Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it’s my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it."
Beth, Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal’s life than my own ego?
Jerry, Hmm… you’d have to be pretty petty. But you’d still be the woman I married.
Beth, Where are we going?
Jerry, One last stop.
Beth, Where’s the helicopter?
Jerry," There is no helicopter, and there is no Cervine Institute."
Beth, But the top deer surgeon…
Jerry, I’m looking at her. Thanks for F.D.’ing me up like that.
Cold Stone Employee," You’d better get moving, these lights are designed for basic ice cream work, they’re not gonna last all night."
Beth, I need 5 minutes.
Beth," Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I’ve ever had."
Jerry, Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.
Cold Stone Employee, You’re welcome.
 All Ricks," Okay, we’re out of time. It’s ironic, huh?"
Morty," Yes, oh, yes, yes!"
Summer, Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Morty," Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right."
Rick," You know what I’m talking about, oh yeah. I’m gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I’m doing the cabbage patch dance. It’s a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that."
Morty, Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.
Summer," Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?"
Morty, I don’t know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn’t work. It’s hard to keep straight now that I have sixty three other memories of everything.
Rick, Yeah.
Morty," But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think."
Rick," Shut up Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit."
Beth," Hey guys, we’re home."
 Summer," Mom, Dad!"
Jerry," Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?"
Beth, *laughs*
Jerry," Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they’re just fruity necklaces is all I was saying."
Beth, *laughing* I’m gonna pee my pants.
Morty, Doesn’t feel so good does it?
Rick, No it doesn’t. It hurts.
Beth, I’m gonna pee-hee-hee.
Jerry," Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90’s? What is this a 90’s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?"
Testicle Monster A," Hey man, when the hell were you?"
Testicle Monster B," Looking for you, asshole."
Testicle Monster A, I told you past the dinosaurs.
Testicle Monster B, You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time!
Testicle Monster A," Come on man, it’s this way…"
Testicle Monster B," Come on, give me that thing, speed it up, he can’t be this far back."
Testicle Monster A," There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop."
Testicle Monster B," So that’s the guy, huh?"
Testicle Monster A," Yeah, that’s him. Hey, man, remember me? [him and Monster B starts beating up Einstein, knocking him to the ground] I got something for your ass! You don’t mess with time! You don’t f*** with time, mother****er! [him and Monster B leaves]"
Albert Einstein, I vill mess vith time!
Albert Einstein, I vill mess vith time…
