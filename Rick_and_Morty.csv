Rick," Morty, you got to come on. You got to come with me."
Morty," Rick, what’s going on?"
Rick," I got a surprise for you, Morty."
Morty, It’s the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Rick, I got a surprise for you.
Morty, Ow! Ow! You’re tugging me too hard.
Rick," I got a surprise for you, Morty."
Rick," What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage."
Morty," Yeah, Rick, it’s great. Is this the surprise?"
Rick," Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."
Morty, What?! A bomb?!
Rick," We’re gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start."
Morty, T-t-that’s absolutely crazy!
Rick," Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It’s gonna be good. Right now, we’re gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."
Morty, Jessica? From my math class?
Rick," When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I’m gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you’re gonna be Adam."
Morty, Whoa.
Rick," And Jessica’s gonna be Eve,…"
Morty, Whhhh-wha?
Rick," And so that’s the surprise, Morty."
Morty," No, you can’t! Jessica doesn’t even know I exist but but forget about that, because you can’t blow up humanity."
Rick," I-I get what you’re trying to say, Morty. Listen, I’m not you don’t you don’t got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I’m I’m not that kind of guy, Morty."
Morty," What are you talking about, Rick?"
Rick," You you don’t have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she’s all for you, Morty."
Morty," I don’t care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You’re right."
Rick," Let’s forget the girl all together. She she’s probably nothing but trouble, anyways."
Robot Voice, Arming neutrino bomb.
Morty," That’s it that’s it, Rick. I’m taking the wheel."
Rick," Get off of me, Morty!"
Morty," I’m taking charge of this situation, buddy. What’s gotten into you? I’m I’m I’m I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world."
Rick," All right, all right. I’ll I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden."
Rick," We’ll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here."
Morty," Oh, thank God."
Rick," You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
Morty, It was?
Rick," Sure. Why not? I don’t know. You you know what, mo-"
Robot Voice, Neutrino bomb armed.
Morty, Um…
Jerry, I see there’s a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
Summer," Oh, my God, his head is in his food. I’m going to puke."
Beth," Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow. The dog sleeps on it."
Morty," I wasn’t kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."
Summer, Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.
Rick," What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
Jerry, Damn it!
Jerry, Beth!
Summer," Oh, my God, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
Rick," Mm, there is no God, Summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You’ll thank me later."
Jerry," Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
Rick," Listen, Jerry, I don’t want to overstep my bounds or anything. It’s your house. It’s your world. You’re a real Julius Caesar but I’ll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It’s a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it’s it’s not a place for smart people, Jerry and I know that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s my two cents on the issue."
Rick," This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
Jerry, What? For real?
 Goldenfold," All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we’re gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It’s called math and without it, none of us would even exist, so let’s jump right in. 2 plus 2."
All classmates except Morty, 4.
Morty, Jessica.
 Goldenfold, 5 plus 5.
All classmates except Morty, 10.
Morty, Jessica.
 Goldenfold," Okay, good. It’s time for the quiz."
Jessica," Hi, Morty."
Morty," Whoa! Hi, Jessica."
Jessica, Can I show these to you?
Morty, Wow. Th-they’re both great.
Jessica, Thank you. You know what I named these? My little Morties.
Morty," Uh, that’s flattering and a little weird."
Jessica, Do you know what I want you to do with them?
Morty, Rename them?
Jessica," Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
Morty," Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let’s give this a shot."
Jessica," Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?"
Morty," Uh, I-I’m just doing my best."
 Goldenfold, Morty!
Morty, Jessica.
Morty, Je-Jessica. Jessica.
 Goldenfold, Not my fault this is happening.
Frank," Well, well, well."
Frank," ""Morning""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family’s poor?"
Morty," Oh, geez, Frank. I don’t know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
Frank," You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I’m gonna cut you, ‘cause my family’s rich."
Rick," There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what’d you do to Frank?"
Rick," It’s pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (Belch) It’s important. Come on, Morty."
Morty," I don’t know, Rick. I can’t leave school again."
Rick," Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
Morty," Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn’t you unfreeze him?"
Rick," I’ll do it later, Morty. He’ll be fine. Let’s go."
Summer," Hi, Frank. (Frank’s frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying) AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!"
Beth, Scalpel. Davin: Scalpel.
Jerry," (enters the room) Knock, knock."
Beth, Jerry?
Jerry," My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"""
Beth," Jerry, please tell me you’re here for an incredibly urgent reason."
Jerry," Well, it’s lunch. I mean, it’s one of three meals that have existed for millennia."
Beth," Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
Jerry," Well, yeah, on horses."
Beth," Hey, Tom! We know when we’re losing him. (At the top of her lungs) WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"
Rick," There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let’s go."
Morty," Oh, geez, okay."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?"
Rick," It’s Dimension 35-C, and it’s got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there’s fruit in those trees, and there’s seeds in those fruits. I’m talking about mega seeds. They’re they’re incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick. I’m looking around this place, and I’m starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
Rick," All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You’re looking around, and it’s all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that’s how we grow as people. I’m no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we’re gonna be-"
Rick," I never seen that thing before in my life. I don’t even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It’s gonna kill us! We’re gonna die! We’re gonna die, Morty!"
Rick," Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That’s the smell of adventure, Morty. That’s-that’s the smell of of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
Morty," All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn’t I be back at school by now?"
Rick," Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. (A weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) What the hell is that thing? You think you’re gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic, that thing."
Morty," Yeah, Rick, I get it. We’re surrounded by monsters. That’s kind of the reason why I want to leave."
Rick," Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?"
Rick," You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?"
Morty, The mega trees?
Rick," That’s right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that’s what I’m talking about, Morty. That’s where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you’re so in love with school."
Morty," All right, all right. So, what’s so special about these seeds, anyways?"
Rick," You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an (belch) Under (belch) underfoot figure."
Rick," Just take these shoes, Morty. They’re (belch) special grappling shoes. When you’re wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
Morty, AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
Rick," You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!"
Beth," I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month’s Victoria’s secret?"
Jerry," I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine’s day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
Davin," Everything cool in here, Beth?"
Beth," It’s fine, Davin."
Davin," Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There’s nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse."
Jerry," Since we’re fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
Beth," Look, I appreciate the stress you’re under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend."
Beth," Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I’m my father’s daughter. I’m smart. Why do you think I’m a heart surgeon?"
Jerry," (Cough) Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
Principal Vagina," Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty’s father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"
Rick," Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on (Offscreen) your legs right now. You know, you got to turn (Onscreen) the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
Morty," I’m in a lot of pain, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you’ll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?"
Rick," Okay, hold on just a second, Morty."
Morty, Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
Rick," Don’t worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"
Morty," Sure thing, Rick."
Rick," Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (Offscreen) The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
Morty," Wow, that’s pretty crazy, Rick."
Rick," There’s just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that (belch) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. (belch) It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it’s got no charge left, Morty. It’s got no charge left."
Morty, What?!
Rick," It’s as good as garbage, Morty. It’s not gonna work anymore, Morty."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick, that’s not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?"
Rick," There’s ways to get back home, Morty. It’s just it’s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We’re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you’re gonna have to do me a real solid."
Morty, Uh-oh.
Rick," When we get to customs, I’m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I’m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."
Morty, In my butt?
Rick," Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. I really don’t want to have to do that."
Rick," Well, somebody’s got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren’t gonna get through customs unless they’re in someone’s rectum, Morty"
Morty, Uuuh.
Rick," And they’ll fall right out of mine. I’ve done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you’re young. Y-y-you’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y(belch)-you’ve got to put these seeds inside your butt."
Morty, In my butt?
Rick," Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty."
Morty," Oh, man."
Principal Vagina," The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
Beth, What? Why didn’t you notify us?
Principal Vagina, I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I’ve been leaving with Morty’s grandfather?
Jerry," Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?"
Principal Vagina," Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it’s usually Morty’s grandpa that’s taking him out of school."
Beth, Summer?
Principal Vagina, We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. (chuckles) And there’s no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won’t let them.
Announcer, The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
Alien," So, I told him, ""give me the blimfarx,"" you know? This this guy he doesn’t understand interstellar currency."
Alien," It’s, like, I’m trying to eat a flimflam like, that’s what we eat on girvonesk."
Announcer, The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
Rick," I don’t like it here, Morty. I can’t abide bureaucracy. I don’t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?"
Morty," Yeah, Rick. Let’s just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy."
Rick," That means they’re good ones. You’re a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You’ve been a huge help to me. I’m gonna be able to do a-(Belch)-all kind of things with them. It’s gonna be great, Morty. A-(Belch)-all kinds of science."
Gromfomite," Okay, next through. (Stops Morty) Except you. You go over there."
Rick, Why does he have to go over there?
Gromfomite, Random check. He’s got to go through the new machine.
Rick, What new (Belch) what new machine?
Gromfomite, It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
Rick," Run, Morty! Run!"
Morty, Aaaaaah!
Gromfomite, Red alert!
Morty, Ohhhhh!
Morty, Ohhhhhh!
Rick, Don’t think about it!
Rick," Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher."
Morty, Whoooooo!
Alien," Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I’m just trying to-"
Rick," I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me."
Morty," Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don’t want to shoot nobody."
Rick," They’re just robots, Morty! It’s okay to shoot them! They’re robots!"
Glenn, Aaaaah! My leg is shot off!
Other Gromfomite, Glenn’s bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children!
Morty," They’re not robots, Rick!"
Rick," It’s a figure of speech, Morty. They’re bureaucrats. I don’t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!"
Morty, Holy crap! This is insane!
Rick," Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!"
Jessica, Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
Jessica," You’re Morty, right?"
Rick," You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass."
Rick," Oh, hi, Jerry. (poorly acting) Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior… No? No takers?"
Rick, You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It’s beyond your reasoning.
Rick, Takes one to know one.
Rick, What-what are you guys doing with my stuff?
Beth, We’re moving you to a nursing home.
Rick," A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I’m a genius. I build robots for fun."
Jerry," Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas."
Morty," Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."
Jerry," Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
Rick, What are you trying to say about Morty? That he’s stupid or something?
Beth," Oh, don’t high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
Rick, I-I-I don’t know what you mean by that. Can-can-can you be a little bit more specific?
Jerry," Oh, for crying out- he’s got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?"
Morty, I do?
Jerry," Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you’re not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
Morty," Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that’s a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
Rick," Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
Morty," Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can’t."
Rick," The square root of pi, Morty. Go!"
Morty, 1.77245385 Whoa!
Beth, What the hell?
Jerry, Holy crap. He’s right.
Rick," Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
Morty," ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I’m so smart!"
Jerry, But-
Rick, I told the both of you school is stupid. It’s not how you learn things. Morty’s a gifted child. He has a special mind. That’s why he’s my little helper. He’s like me. He’s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He’s too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
Beth," Jerry, I don’t want whatever’s happening here to stop."
Jerry," No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
Rick," Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it’s gonna be clear communication."
Rick, No idea what you’re talking about.
Jerry," Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it’s your bedtime in an hour. Don’t stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you’ll have me, I would love to have you."
Beth, You know what? Okay.
Morty," Holy cow, Rick. I didn’t know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
Rick," Full disclosure, Morty it’s not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
Morty," Aw, man."
Rick," Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you’re gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you’re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
Morty," Ohh, man. (Losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh."
Rick," I’m sorry, Morty. It’s a bummer. In reality, you’re as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we’re gonna have to go get more"
TV, Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby.
Jerry, What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? (Sigh)
Jerry, Outside?
Jerry, Are you kidding me?! Come on!
Summer," Oh, my God."
Morty, What's wrong?
Jerry, Your idiot dog!
Morty," Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy."
Jerry," Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!"
Rick," Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."
Jerry," Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
Rick," I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty."
Jerry," Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!"
Summer, Ha-ha!
Morty," Aw, man!"
Rick," Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
Rick," All right, Ruffles What's his name?"
Morty, Snuffles.
Rick," Snuffles, shake."
Rick, Roll over.
Rick, Go to the bathroom.
Jerry, Holy crap!
Summer, No way.
Rick," Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty."
Morty," That was fantastic, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
Morty, W-w-w-what is it?
Rick," It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about."
Morty," You talking about ""Inception""?"
Rick," That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may-(Belch)-be make sense."
Morty," ""Inception"" made sense."
Rick," You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time."
Morty," Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
Rick," Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
Rick," Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me."
 Pancakes, You don't know me!
 Goldenfold,"' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice."
Commercial Announcer," Next week on ""The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"""
 Pancakes, You don't know me!
 Pancakes," Then let me get to know yo, damn it!"
Rick, Uh-oh! Spoilers!
Rick, I'm a full season behind.
Morty," Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird."
Rick," It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty."
 Pancakes, Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
 Goldenfold, I'll take two.
 Pancakes," Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
Goldenfold, You don't know me.
Rick," All right, Morty, time to make our move."
 Goldenfold, Make it bounce.
 Pancakes," No, you didn't."
 Goldenfold," Oh, jiggle it now."
 Pancakes, You better stop with that.
Rick, Allahu (Belch) akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
Rick," Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
 Goldenfold, The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
Rick," Take cover, Morty!"
 Goldenfold, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Morty, Ooohhh!
Rick," Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. (Belch) I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty."
Morty, What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
Rick," Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!"
Jerry, Now bring me my slippers.
Summer," Now, be my footstool, Snuffles."
Jerry, This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
Jerry," You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?"
Snuffles, Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
Summer," Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something. (Offscreen) That is so awesome."
Snuffles, Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
Jerry," Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna""."
Snuffles, Ooooyayawawa!
Summer," He's saying ""I love Obama"". (Offscreen) So cute! I'm posting this (Onscreen) online, like, right now."
Jerry, I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
Snuffles, Hmm?
Rick," Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
Goldenfold, Why would I negotiate with you?
Rick, Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
 Goldenfold, Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
Plane Passengers, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick," Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking."
Plane Passenger, Oh no! Run!
Plane Passengers, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Morty, Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
Morty, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Rick," Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!"
 Pancakes," Hey, you don't know me!"
Morty," Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a (Offscreen) mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!"
Rick," Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!"
 Pancakes, You don't know m-
Rick," All right, let's go."
Morty," Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird."
Rick," Don't judge, Morty."
Morty," Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
Rick," Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch."
M Monster," Ooh, hey!"
Morty," Ooh, oh! Oh, man."
M Monster, Come and join us.
Morty," I'm sorry. No, no."
M Monster," Ooh, come here!"
Morty," No, thanks!"
Giant Frog Woman," Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby!"
Morty," No, I'm okay."
Morty, Whoa!
Summer," Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?"
Morty, Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
Rick," Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here."
Morty," It's Summer! Aw, geez."
Summer," Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
Centaur, Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads!
Rick," Time to go another dream deep, Morty!"
Morty, What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
Rick," Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?"
Scary Terry," Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!"
Rick," Oh, here we go!"
Morty, Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
Rick, Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
Scary Terry," I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
Jerry," Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?"
Snuffles, Snuffles fix. Make better.
Summer, Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
Snuffles, Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
Jerry," Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over."
Summer," Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away."
Jerry, Why not?
Summer, I don't know. It's Indian giving.
TV," A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy."
Summer," Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
Little Girl," ""A,"" ""b"" his name is scary Terry ""C,"" ""d"" he's very scary."
Rick," Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!"
Morty," Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!"
Little Girl," ""E,"" ""f"" he'll design your death"
Rick, The little girl!
Morty, Huh?
Little Girl," ""J,"" ""k,"" he'll really ruin your day."
Rick," Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty."
Morty," Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good."
Scary Terry," Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!"
Morty, Ohhhh!
Rick," Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!"
Snuffles," Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?"
Snuffles, Do not call me that!
Snuffles," ""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
Summer," Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me."
Snuffles, Scaring you?
Summer, AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Snuffles," Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?"
Summer, Uhhh ...
Jerry," Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?"
Snuffles," Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?"
Summer, Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
Snuffles, You will walk when it is time to walk.
Rick, What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
Morty," We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
Rick," Oh, yeah."
Scary Terry," Buckle up, bitch!"
Morty, Ooooooaaahhh!
Morty," Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!"
Scary Terry," You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
Rick," Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
Morty, But that's the opposite of what-
Rick," Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
Morty," Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."
Rick, Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
Morty," Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking."
Rick," Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
Scary Terry, You can run But you can't hide! (Yawn)
Rick," Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move."
Jerry," Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding."
Summer," Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
Jerry," Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous."
Snuffles," You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
Jerry, Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
Scary Melissa," Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day?"
Scary Terry, I don't want to talk about it!
Scary Terry," Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
Scary Melissa," I love you, too, Terry."
Rick," Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
Rick, Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Morty," Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry."
Scary Terry," Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!"
Monster Teacher," Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?"
Scary Terry," Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
Monster Teacher," Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Morty: Hey, leave him alone!"
Rick," Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
Monster Teacher," Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this."
Rick," You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
Morty," Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool."
Scary Terry," Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say."
Morty," You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
Rick," You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip."
Scary Terry," Oh, hey, it's you guys!"
Scary Melissa, I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.
Scary Terry," If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
Rick," As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
Little Girl,"' ""Q,"" ""r,"" you won't get very far."
Scary Terry, I always hated that song!
Scary Terry," These halves don't belong together, bitch!"
Scary Terry, Sex is sacred!
Scary Terry," This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!"
 Goldenfold," Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought."
Morty, What the hell?
Rick," Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?"
Morty," Oh, man, what's going on?"
Rick," Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
Jerry, I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
Summer, This is why I choose to get C's.
Rick," Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
Morty,"- Dad! - Rick! - Oh, thank God, Morty."
Rick, If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
Jerry," Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it."
Rick," It's all over, Jerry."
Jerry," Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. (Jerry pees on a pile of guns) See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them."
Snuffles, Bad person. Bad.
Rick," Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
Snuffles," Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side."
Morty," Th-thanks, snuffles."
Snuffles, Begin phase two.
Reporter, Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. (Two dogs come into the news room with a muzzle)
Bill," I think she's saying, ""I love lasagna."
Morty," Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!"
Rick," No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon."
Morty, What?
Rick," It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream."
Morty, But I-it's been like a whole year!
Rick," It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
Morty," Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
Rick," No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
Morty," Aw, man, geez! Seriously?"
Rick," Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
Morty," Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
Rick, Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
Morty, What?!
Rick," It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg."
 Dog," It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation."
Snuffles, Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
Accountant Dog," Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom."
Snuffles," To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness."
Accountant Dog, Do you think they would have done this for us?
Snuffles, We are not them! We are not them. (Snuffles wakes up from the dream) Assemble the troops. I've made a decision.
Snuffles," Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory."
Morty," I'm gonna miss you, snowball."
Snuffles," You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much."
Beth, Jerry?
Jerry," I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller."
Beth," Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
Morty," Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick."
Rick," I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven."
Morty," You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick."
Rick," What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
Scary Glenn," Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill."
Rick," Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch. (Terry and Rick are getting stoned)"
Jerry, *singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!
Jerry," *singing* In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham."
Jerry," Um, Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?"
Beth, Alive? For your parents?
Jerry, Good one.
Beth, Hey man!
Jerry, You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.
Morty," *not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something."
Jerry," Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now."
Morty, *hands over his tablet* Ohhhh…
Summer," Dad, I’m not giving you my phone."
Jerry," Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I’m joining Facebook."
Rick," *offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody."
Jerry, More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
Rick," Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend."
Ruben, Pearl Harbor.
Rick, I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.
Beth," Aw, Dad… That is so sweet."
Jerry," *squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don’t get it."
Ruben, Korea.
Rick," Don’t worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I’ll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise."
Jerry," Huh. You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there’s my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!"
Leonard," Merry Christmas, son."
Jerry," Oh, hi. Can I help you?"
Joyce," Jerry, this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn’t you get our text message?"
 and Morty, No.
Jacob, You must be Jerry! That’s a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?
Jerry, *smiling uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you’re a…friend of the family…?
Leonard," *puts an arm around Jacob’s shoulders* The way we see it, he’s a part of the family."
Jerry, Wow!
Joyce," After your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?"
Beth," Holy crap, Joyce. That’s amazing."
Leonard, Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.
Jacob, All three of us.
Jerry, …Cool… Eggnog?
Jacob," Now we are talkin’! This man’s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?"
Rick," Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there."
Jacob," Merry Christmas, man."
Rick, Morty! A moment of your time?
Rick," He’s in bad shape, Morty."
Morty," Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?"
Rick," Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I’m sittin’ here trying to save the guy’s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He’ll know what’s goin’ on."
Morty, *extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
Rick, In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head*
Morty, Ruben… Minnesota?
Rick," Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don’t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse."
Morty, W-What proc—
Beth," Hey Dad, where's Morty?"
Rick, He's busy.
Morty, Rick… Where am I?
Rick," *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance."
Rick," Welcome, Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty gasps.) …to Anatomy Park!"
Rick," It’s a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn’t cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead."
Morty, Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
Rick," You got a problem with that last one, Morty?"
Morty," Huh? No, no, I’m just reading them out loud in the order I’m seeing them."
Rick," Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby."
Rick," I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I’m still a little defensive. Let’s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I’m picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty."
Rick, Proceed to the liver.
Automated voice, Arriving at ‘Liver’.
Morty, *stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!
Automated voice, Mind the gap.
Morty," It’s really scary in here, Rick."
Rick," Liver’s under maintenance. Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. Don’t judge. You don’t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great."
Morty," OOOOHHH! Rick, it’s a monster!"
Rick," No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf."
Poncho, Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
Morty, Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
 Bloom, Poncho! That’s quite enough.
 Bloom," Morty, that’s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is Roger and Annie."
Morty, *staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh…
 Bloom, And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
Rick," Hey Bloom, it’s Rick. What the hell’s goin’ on here?"
 Bloom," I don’t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I’m afraid the exhibits are unlocked."
Morty, Exhibits?
 Bloom," Anatomy Park’s greatest attraction, young man, isn’t the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas."
Rick, Watch it.
 Bloom, It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity’s most noble and ferocious diseases.
Morty, Diseases?!
Poncho," Hey Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living museum is officially a wild safari!"
Roger, Hepatitis A! Run!
Jacob," Oh… *leans over and wipes some food from Joyce’s mouth with a napkin* The food goes in your mouth, girl!"
Jerry," Aha… I’m sorry Jacob, I guess I’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?"
Joyce," We can go into detail later, son."
Leonard," Now wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. Let’s all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry’s smile becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment."
Jerry," Dad, please, what are you saying?"
Beth," Whatever it is, it’s beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you."
Jerry," Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say Jacob is your lover."
Leonard," No no no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother’s lover. (Jerry again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman."
Jacob, Oh… *reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*
Jacob," Jerry, this ham’s got to be all you, right? It’s in-cred-i-ble."
Summer," *smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad."
Poncho, AHHHHHH!
 Bloom, Hepatitis won’t follow us into the respiratory system!
Roger, That’s strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.
 Bloom, So the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. That’s why security is offline.
Morty," W-Well, I guess we better check it out."
Alexander," Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*"
 Bloom, *points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!
Roger," If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage."
Morty, *raises his hand* I’ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh…
Poncho," Don’t be a hero, kid."
Morty, I’m not. I’m doin’ it because it’s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*
Poncho, *cocks his gun* We shouldn’t be here.
 Bloom," Whatever you do, don’t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life’s work."
Annie, Ah!
 Bloom," It’s alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!"
Morty, Whoa! *grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!
Morty, Oh! What are those things?!
 Bloom," Tuberculosis, coming in fast!"
Poncho, *raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!
 Bloom, *grabs Poncho’s arm* No! Do you know what you’ve done?!
 Bloom, Get to the digestive tract! He’s coughing!
Alexander, Waaaah! Don’t let me die!
Rick," Just take a deep breath, Ruben."
Morty, You’re not gonna die! What’s your name?
Alexander, My name is… *his hand slips from Morty’s and he’s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!
Morty, Rick! Ruben’s got tuberculosis!
Rick," Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I’ll just cure it, and then—"
Rick," Okay. Well I can’t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You’re trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—"
Rick," —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I’m biased, but, I think it’s great, Morty."
Rick," *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don’t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I’m just saying, if that becomes impossible—"
Rick," —please, you gotta treat yourself."
Morty," Geez, what’s that horrible smell?"
 Bloom," You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I’m kidding. (As he speaks, Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed."
Morty," Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!"
 Bloom, The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There’s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
Morty, Everybody! Get to the colon!
Poncho, Now I’m takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
 Bloom, Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
Roger, Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.
Morty," Hey, just so you know, I-I’m actually fourteen. So, you know…"
Annie, What?
Morty, Not twelve.
Annie, Okay.
Morty, Because he just said I was twelve.
Annie, Oh. Good for you.
Morty, *slumps forward* Nnn…
Animatronics," *singing* It’s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It’s a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It’s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It’s a small, small intestine!"
Roger, It goes on like this for miles…
 Bloom, *excitedly* And then we get to the large intestine!
Poncho, Shh. *shines flashlight* I hear something.
 Bloom, *whispers* Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move.
 Bloom, Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
Annie, We’re sitting ducks!
Morty, Doc! Didn’t you say the body was filling up with gas?
 Bloom, Yes. Why?
Poncho, Kid! You’re a genius! *pulls out a match*
 Bloom, Are you mad?!
Morty, *grabs Annie’s hand* Everybody! In here!
Poncho, Hey Gonorrhea! How’s this for a burning sensation?
Summer," *singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!"
Leonard," Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha."
Summer, Christmas drums being played by a boy!
Beth," Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted."
Jerry," I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I’m being punished for taking your iPad."
Beth," What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I’m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let’s just be here."
Ethan, Ugh… Summer!
Summer," *stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?"
Ethan, I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
Summer, I don’t have my phone! I’m doing a human holiday!
Ethan, Did you even consider how that might make me feel?
Summer, How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
Jerry," *stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?"
Ethan," Yeah, do you, Summer?"
Summer," I don’t know Ethan, do I?"
Jacob," *stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer’s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man."
Roger," I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we’ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben’s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery."
Poncho, What the hell is that?
 Bloom," The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load."
Roger," Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!"
Morty, Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
 Bloom," That’s bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?"
Poncho, Everybody get back!
 Bloom," Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?"
Poncho," *laughs* That’s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I’ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—"
Morty, AHHHHH!!!
Poncho, Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!
Annie, You guys!
Roger," It’s gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck!"
Annie, No!
Roger," This is okay! It’s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you can—"
Annie, No!
Jacob," Let me ask you something Ethan. Where’s the anger coming from, man?"
Ethan, From Summer being a total bitch!
Jacob, Where’s the anger coming from?
Ethan, …My brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can’t… I can’t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I’m… m-made me a girl!
Jacob," He didn’t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to her. Brand new."
Ethan, Come here right now!
Summer," Oh my god, I’m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!"
Ethan, I love you so much.
Jerry, Um…
Joyce," You did it again, cubby. Come here."
Jerry, No! Stop! I hate this!
Joyce," Well, Christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son."
Jerry," Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame."
Animatronic Ruben," My name’s Ruben Ridley. You’re inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I’ll be inside all of you."
Animatronic Ruben, My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.
Annie, *whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want…
Rick, I’m trying to concentrate.
Jerry," Ah, Rick?"
Rick," *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry."
Jerry," *enters anyway* I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben’s corpse* Right now, you’re my sanest relative."
Rick," Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?"
Morty," Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick."
Morty, We need to get to the left nipple!
 Bloom," The body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the ‘ceiling’.) The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It’s connected to the skeletal system. That’s why we call it the Bone Train. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?"
Annie, If it’ll get us out of here.
 Bloom," How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?"
Morty, Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let’s go.
Jerry," Well, I can see that you’re busy… Merry Christmas, Rick."
 Anatomy Park, the Bone Train]
 Bloom, There’s no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
Morty," …Uh, well…"
 Bloom," No, you’re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on."
Annie, *points* What the hell is that?
 Bloom, E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
 Bloom," Oh wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!"
Annie, They’re chewing through the doors!
Morty," Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!"
Rick," I’m almost there, Morty!"
Reporter, Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
Tom," Well, his eyes aren’t twinkling, and his dimples aren’t merry, but I’m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!"
Reporter," Thank you, Tom. Let’s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles."
Eric," We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man’s size! And you know what they say about that!"
Reporter," Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains."
Morty," Oh my god, the track!"
Annie, It’s Hepatitis A!
Annie, The nipple hole…
Morty, It’s beautiful…
Annie, Aw no!
Annie, Whoa! It’s Hepatitis C!
Morty, Um… We… Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
Annie, I… think they’re just like that? I think they’re just good guys.
Morty, Oh. Huh.
Rick, Where’s Dr. Bloom?
Morty, Sorry Rick… He’s dead…
Rick," Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!"
Beth, Jerry doesn’t know what he’s missing.
Jacob," He’ll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together."
Beth," I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don’t know if our marriage will—"
Summer, It’s raining blood!
Jacob," Oh, shit. find Jerry!"
Beth, Oh god.
Beth, Jerry!
Jerry, *stands and hugs her* It’s alright! The TV says there’s nothing to worry about.
Summer," Dad, can I have my phone back?"
Jerry," Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It’ll help you relax."
Jacob, This is nice.
Jerry," Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob."
Summer," No we didn’t, Dad. No we didn’t."
Rick," Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park."
Annie," Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom’s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!"
Rick, What about Pirates of the Pancreas…?
Annie, I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
Rick, Booyah! Hold your breath!
Morty," Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!"
Rick," Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina."
Morty, W-What’s wrong with that? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
Rick," C’mon. Let’s get some stuffing, I’m starving."
Rick," Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?"
Rick," Loud and clear, Annie."
Annie," Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—"
Alejandro, Hey Rick.
Annie," Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media."
Rick, Hey everybody.
All," Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin'. (etc.)"
Annie, So. Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick," Yeah, talk to me."
Alejandro," Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” (Rick begins to look agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—"
Ethan," So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?"
Rick," Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They’re inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan."
Ethan, … Cool. And who pays me?
